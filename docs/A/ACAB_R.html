                  <p>The Board has adopted these employee procedures in
                  order to provide prompt and equitable resolution of
                  employee complaints of discrimination and harassment,
                  including sexual harassment, as described in policies
                  AC - Nondiscrimination/Equal Opportunity and
                  Affirmative Action and ACAB - Harassment and Sexual
                  Harassment of School Employees.</p>
                  <p>The complaint procedure in Section 2 may also be
                  used, to the extent applicable, by visitors, including
                  parents, volunteers and others having lawful access to
                  the schools who wish to make a complaint of
                  discrimination or harassment.</p>
                  <p>Complaints alleging harassment or discrimination
                  against students based on a protected category should

                  Harassment Complaint Procedures (ACAA-R).</p>
                  <p>Any individual who is unsure about whether
                  discrimination or harassment has occurred and/or which
                  complaint procedure applies is encouraged to contact

                  <p>For purposes of these complaint procedures, the
                  following definitions will be used. The Affirmative
                  Action Officer/Title IX Coordinator shall assess all
                  reports and complaints to ensure that they are
                  addressed under the appropriate policy and complaint
                  procedure.</p>

                  <li><p>Discrimination/Harassment Complaint Procedure
                  Definitions</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>“Discrimination or harassment”: Discrimination
                  or harassment on the basis of an individual’s
                  membership in a protected category, which, for
                  employees, includes race, color, sex, sexual
                  orientation, gender identity, age, religion, ancestry,
                  national origin, genetic information or
                  disability.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Discrimination”: Treating individuals
                  differently, or interfering with or preventing them
                  from enjoying the advantages or privileges afforded to
                  others because of their membership in a protected
                  category.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Harassment”: Oral, written, graphic,
                  electronic or physical conduct relating to an
                  individual’s actual or perceived membership in a
                  protected category that is sufficiently severe,
                  pervasive or persistent so as to interfere with or
                  limit that individual’s ability to participate in the
                  school’s programs or activities by creating a hostile,
                  intimidating or offensive environment.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Under Title VII and under Maine
                  law/regulations, sexual harassment is defined
                  differently than under Title IX. Maine Human Rights
                  Commission regulations define sexual harassment as
                  conduct on the basis of sex which satisfies one or
                  more of the following:</p>
                  <ol type="a">
                  <li><p>Submission to such conduct is made either
                  explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an
                  individual’s employment;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Submission to or rejection of such conduct by
                  an employee is used as the basis for employment
                  decisions affecting the employee; or</p></li>
                  <li><p>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of
                  unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work
                  performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
                  offensive working environment.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>“Sexual orientation”: Under Maine law, this
                  means a person’s “actual or perceived heterosexuality,
                  bisexuality, homosexuality or gender identity or
                  expression.”</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Gender identity”: Under Maine law, this means
                  “the gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms
                  or other gender-related characteristics of an
                  individual, regardless of the individual’s assigned
                  sex at birth.”</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Complaint” is defined as an allegation that an
                  employee or other third party has been discriminated
                  against or harassed on the basis of race, color, sex,
                  sexual orientation, gender identity, age, religion,
                  ancestry, national origin, genetic information or
                  disability (and in regard to sex, conduct not
                  otherwise addressed in the Title IX regulations and
                  Section 3 of ACAB-R).</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Employee”: Whenever the term “employee” is
                  used in Section 2, it includes visitors or others who
                  have a lawful basis to make a complaint of
                  discrimination or harassment.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedure
                  Definitions</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>“Title IX sexual harassment”: Under the federal
                  Title IX regulations, sexual harassment includes the
                  following conduct on the basis of sex which takes
                  place within the context of the school’s education
                  programs and activities:</p>
                  <ol type="a">
                  <li><p>“Quid pro quo” sexual harassment by a school
                  employee: Conditioning a school aid, benefit or
                  service (such as a promotion or favorable evaluation)
                  on an individual’s participation in unwelcome sexual
                  conduct;</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Hostile environment” sexual harassment:
                  Unwelcome conduct based on sex that a reasonable
                  person would determine is so severe, pervasive and
                  objectively offensive that it effectively denies an
                  individual’s equal access to the school’s education
                  programs and activities; or</p></li>
                  <li><p>Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic
                  violence and stalking as these terms are defined in
                  federal laws.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>“Report”: Under the Title IX regulations, any
                  individual may make a report of sexual harassment
                  involving an employee, whether the individual is the
                  alleged victim or not. A report must be made to the
                  Affirmative Action Officer/Title IX Coordinator. A
                  report triggers certain actions by the AAO/Title IX
                  Coordinator for the alleged victim of sexual
                  harassment, but an investigation is not conducted
                  unless a “Formal Complaint” is filed.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Formal Complaint”: Under Title IX, the alleged
                  victim of sexual harassment can file a written
                  complaint that triggers the complaint procedure in
                  Section 3 of ACAB-R. Only a school employee (and in
                  certain circumstances, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator)
                  may file a formal complaint.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Employee”: For the purpose of this procedure,
                  “employee” means an applicant for employment or a
                  current employee of the school.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>DISCRIMINATION/HARASSMENT COMPLAINT
                  PROCEDURE</p>
                  <p>This procedure should be used for any complaint of
                  unlawful harassment or discrimination based on a
                  protected category which does not involve Title IX
                  sexual harassment.</p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p>How to Make A Complaint</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>An employee who believes they have been
                  unlawfully harassed or discriminated against (as such
                  terms are defined in Section 1.A.1-3) is encouraged to
                  try to resolve the problem by informing the
                  individual(s) that the behavior is unwelcome or
                  offensive, and requesting that the behavior stop. This
                  shall not prevent the employee from making an
                  immediate complaint to the AAO/Title IX
                  Coordinator.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Any employee who believes they have been
                  harassed or discriminated against should report their
                  concern promptly to the AAO/Title IX Coordinator. A
                  written complaint must include basic information
                  concerning the allegation of harassment or
                  discrimination (i.e., date, time, location,
                  individual(s) who allegedly engaged in harassment or
                  discrimination, description of allegation).</p></li>
                  <li><p>Employees who are unsure as to whether unlawful
                  discrimination or harassment has occurred, or who need
                  assistance in preparing a written complaint, are
                  encouraged to discuss the matter with the AAO/Title IX
                  Coordinator.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Employees will not be retaliated against for
                  reporting suspected discrimination or harassment, or
                  for participating in an investigation. Retaliation is
                  illegal under federal and state nondiscrimination
                  laws, and any retaliation will result in disciplinary
                  measures, up to and including discharge.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Any employee who believes they have been
                  discriminated against or harassed is encouraged to
                  utilize the school’s complaint procedure. However,
                  employees are hereby notified that they also have the
                  right to report incidents of discrimination or
                  harassment to the Maine Human Rights Commission, 51
                  State House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333 (telephone:
                  207-624-6290) and/or to the federal Office for Civil

                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>The AAO/Title IX Coordinator will promptly
                  inform the Executive Director and the person who is
                  the subject of the complaint (respondent) that a
                  complaint has been received.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The AAO/Title IX Coordinator may pursue an
                  informal resolution of the complaint with the
                  agreement of the parties involved. Any party to the
                  complaint may decide to end the informal resolution
                  process and pursue the formal process at any point.
                  Any informal resolution is subject to the approval of
                  the parties and the Executive Director, who shall
                  consider whether the resolution is in the best
                  interest of the school and the parties in light of the
                  particular circumstances and applicable policies and
                  laws.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The AAO/Title IX Coordinator may implement
                  supportive measures (consistent with any applicable
                  collective bargaining agreement provisions) to reduce
                  the risk of further discrimination or harassment while
                  an investigation is pending. Examples of supportive
                  measures include, but are not limited to, ordering no
                  contact between the individuals involved; changing a
                  work location or changing a work schedule.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The complaint will be investigated by a trained
                  internal or external individual designated by the
                  Executive Director and the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.
                  Any complaint about an employee who holds a
                  supervisory position shall be investigated by a person
                  who is not subject to that supervisor’s authority. Any
                  complaint about the Executive Director should be
                  submitted to the Chair of the Board, who should
                  consult with legal counsel concerning the handling and
                  investigation of the complaint.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The investigator shall consult with the
                  AAO/Title IX Coordinator as agreed during the
                  investigation process.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The respondent will be provided with an
                  opportunity to be heard as part of the investigation.
                  The complainant shall not be required to attend
                  meetings with the respondent, but may choose to do so
                  as part of an informal resolution process.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The complainant and the respondent may suggest
                  witnesses and/or submit materials they believe are
                  relevant to the complaint.</p></li>
                  <li><p>If the complaint is against an employee of the
                  school, any rights conferred under an applicable
                  collective bargaining agreement shall be
                  applied.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Privacy rights of all parties to the complaint
                  shall be maintained in accordance with applicable
                  state and federal laws.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The investigation shall be completed within 40
                  business days of receiving the complaint, if
                  practicable. Reasonable extensions of time for good
                  reason shall be allowed.</p></li>

                  <p>This section should be used only for complaints of
                  Title IX sexual harassment as defined in Section
                  1.B.1.</p>

                  <li><p>How to Make A Report</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>Any individual who believes an employee has
                  been sexually harassed (as this term is defined in
                  Section 1.B.1) may make a report to the AAO/Title IX
                  Coordinator.</p></li>
                  <li><p>If the individual making the report is the
                  alleged victim, or if the alleged victim is identified
                  by the individual making the report, the AAO/Title IX
                  Coordinator will meet with the alleged victim to
                  discuss supportive measures that may be appropriate in
                  the particular circumstances and explain the process
                  for filing a formal complaint.</p>
                  <ol type="a">
                  <li><p>Supportive measures are individualized measures
                  designed to ensure the employee can continue to access
                  and perform their work (such as requiring no contact
                  between individuals, temporarily moving work locations
                  or changing schedules, etc.).</p></li>
                  <li><p>Supportive measures may be continued even if
                  the alleged victim chooses not to file a formal
                  complaint, if appropriate under the particular
                  circumstances.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>The school cannot provide an informal
                  resolution process for resolving a report until a
                  formal complaint is filed.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Employees will not be retaliated against for
                  reporting sexual harassment, or for participating in
                  an investigation. Retaliation is illegal under federal
                  and state nondiscrimination laws, and any retaliation
                  will result in disciplinary actions, up to and
                  including discharge.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Any employee who believes they have been the
                  victim of sexual harassment is encouraged to utilize
                  the school’s complaint procedures. However, employees
                  are hereby notified that they also have the right to
                  report sexual harassment to the Maine Human Rights
                  Commission, 51 State House Station, Augusta, Maine
                  04333 (telephone: 207-624-6290) and/or to the federal

                  <li><p>The Executive Director shall be informed of all

                  <li><p>How to Make A Formal Complaint</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>An alleged victim may file a formal written
                  complaint requesting investigation of alleged Title IX
                  sexual harassment. The written complaint must include
                  basic information concerning the allegation of sexual
                  harassment (i.e., date, time, location, individual(s)
                  who alleged engaged in sexual harassment, description
                  of allegation). Employees who need assistance in
                  preparing a formal written complaint, are encouraged
                  to consult with the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.</p></li>
                  <li><p>In certain circumstances, the AAO/Title IX
                  Coordinator may file a formal complaint even when the
                  alleged victim chooses not to. Examples include if the
                  respondent (person alleged to have engaged in sexual
                  harassment) has been found responsible for previous
                  sexual harassment or there is a safety threat within
                  the school). In such cases, the alleged victim is not
                  a party to the case, but will receive notices as
                  required by the Title IX regulations at specific
                  points in the complaint process.</p></li>
                  <li><p>In accordance with the Title IX regulations,
                  the AAO/Title IX Coordinator must dismiss a formal
                  complaint under this Title IX procedure if: a) the
                  conduct alleged in the formal complaint does not
                  constitute sexual harassment under the Title IX
                  regulations and this policy; b) if the conduct alleged
                  did not occur within the scope of the school’s
                  education programs and activities, or c) did not occur
                  in the United States.</p></li>
                  <li><p>In accordance with the Title IX regulations,
                  the AAO/Title IX Coordinator may dismiss a formal
                  complaint under this Title IX procedure if: a) a
                  complainant withdraws the formal complaint, or
                  withdraws particular allegations within the complaint;
                  b) the respondent is no longer employed by the school;
                  or c) there are specific circumstances that prevent
                  the school from gathering evidence sufficient to reach
                  a determination regarding the formal
                  complaint.</p></li>
                  <li><p>If a formal complaint is dismissed under this
                  Title IX procedure, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator will
                  promptly and simultaneously send written notices to
                  the parties explaining the reasons. Parties have the
                  opportunity to appeal dismissals in accordance with
                  subsection I below.</p></li>
                  <li><p>If the conduct alleged potentially violates
                  other laws, Board policies and/or professional
                  expectations, the school may address the conduct under
                  Section 2 or another applicable
                  policy/procedure.</p></li>

                  <li><p>Administrative Leave</p>
                  <p>The Executive Director may place a respondent on
                  administrative leave during the complaint
                  procedure:</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>If there is a determination (following an
                  individualized safety and risk analysis) that there is
                  an immediate threat to the physical health or safety
                  of an individual arising from the allegations of
                  sexual harassment. Examples of such circumstances
                  might include, but are not limited to, a continued
                  threat of violence against a complainant by a
                  respondent, or a respondent’s threat of self-harm due
                  to the allegations.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The respondent will be provided notice of the
                  administrative leave, and will be provided an
                  opportunity to challenge the decision following the
                  removal (this is an opportunity to be heard, not a
                  hearing). The respondent has the burden to demonstrate
                  why the emergency leave was unreasonable.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Any such decision to place an employee on
                  administrative leave shall be made in compliance with
                  any applicable disability laws, including Section 504
                  of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with
                  Disabilities Act.</p></li>

                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>The Title IX Coordinator will provide to the
                  parties written notice of the formal complaint and
                  allegations of sexual harassment potentially
                  constituting prohibited conduct under the Title IX
                  regulations and this procedure. The notice will

                  and the date and location of the alleged incident, if
                  known), with sufficient time to prepare before any
                  initial interview (not less than five business
                  days);</p></li>
                  <li><p>As required by the Title IX regulations, a
                  statement that the respondent is presumed not
                  responsible for the alleged conduct and that a
                  determination of responsibility will be made at the
                  conclusion of the complaint); and that the parties may
                  inspect and review evidence;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Notice that the parties may each have an
                  advisor of their choice (who may be an attorney), and
                  that the parties may inspect and review
                  evidence;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Notice that knowingly making false statements
                  or submitting false information during the complaint
                  procedure is prohibited and may result in disciplinary
                  action; and</p></li>
                  <li><p>Notice of the name of the investigator, with
                  sufficient time (no less than three business days) to

                  bias.</p></li>
                  </ul></li>
                  <li><p>If additional allegations become known at a
                  later time, notice of the additional allegations will
                  be provided to the parties.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The AAO/Title IX Coordinator will discuss
                  supportive measures with each party and implement such
                  measures as appropriate.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>Informal Resolution Process</p>
                  <p>After a formal complaint has been filed, and if the
                  AAO/Title IX Coordinator believes the circumstances
                  are appropriate, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator may
                  offer the parties the opportunity to participate in an
                  informal resolution process to resolve the complaint
                  without completing the investigation and determination
                  process. Informal resolutions cannot be used to
                  resolve a formal complaint where a student is the
                  complainant and the respondent is an employee.</p>
                  <p>Informal resolutions can take many forms, depending
                  on the particular case. Examples include, but are not
                  limited to, facilitated discussions between the
                  parties, restorative justice, acknowledgment of
                  responsibility by a respondent, apologies,

                  agree to the terms of any informal resolution reached
                  between the parties. If an informal resolution
                  agreement is reached, it must be signed by both

                  about the Executive Director should be submitted to
                  the Chair of the Board, who should consult with legal
                  counsel concerning the handling and investigation of

                  in reaching a determination of responsibility), and
