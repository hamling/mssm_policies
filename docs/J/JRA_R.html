                  <li><p>This administrative procedure is intended to
                  assist administrators and School staff in complying
                  with the requirements of federal and state statutes
                  and regulations concerning student education records
                  and information, including special education
                  requirements.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
                  <p>The following definitions apply to terms used in
                  this policy:</p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p>“Act” means the Family Educational Rights and
                  Privacy Act (20 USC § 1232g).</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Directory information” means the following
                  information contained in an education record of a
                  student: name, participation and grade level of
                  students in officially recognized activities and
                  sports, height and weight of student athletes, grade
                  level in School of participants in extracurricular
                  activities, dates of attendance at MSSM, honors and
                  awards received, and photographs and videos relating
                  to School attendance and participation in School
                  activities (except photographs and videos on the
                  Internet).</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Eligible student” means a student who has
                  attained eighteen years of age who has not been judged
                  by a court of competent jurisdiction to be so severely
                  impaired that the student is unable to make decisions
                  or exercise judgment on his/her own behalf. When a
                  student attains the age of eighteen, all rights
                  accorded to parents concerning education records
                  transfer to the eligible student. Students, regardless
                  of age, who have been emancipated by a court of
                  competent jurisdiction, shall be deemed
                  “eligible.”</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Parent” means parent, regardless of divorce or
                  separation, a legal guardian, or individual acting as
                  a parent or guardian provided that there shall be a
                  presumption that a parent has the authority to
                  exercise the rights inherent in the Act, unless there
                  is evidence of a state law or court order governing
                  such matters as divorce, separation or custody, or a
                  legally binding instrument that specifically revokes
                  such rights.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Education Record” means any information or
                  data that directly relates to a student and is
                  maintained by MSSM in any medium, including but not
                  limited to, handwriting, print, computer media, video
                  or audio tape, microfilm and microfiche. Records of
                  instructional, supervisory and administrative
                  personnel and personnel who support these individuals,
                  which are in the sole possession of the maker thereof
                  and which are not accessible or revealed to any other
                  person except a temporary substitute for the person
                  who made the record are excluded from this
                  definition.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“School” means MSSM.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Student” includes any individual with respect
                  to whom MSSM maintains education records.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“Superintendent” shall refer to the senior
                  executive officer of MSSM regardless of the actual
                  title held</p></li>
                  </ol></li>

                  is maintained by MSSM. If the education record of the
                  student or the contested portion is disclosed by MSSM
                  to any party, the explanation shall also be

                  <p>There are several exceptions to the requirement to
                  obtain prior written consent before disclosing
                  education records as follows:</p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p><strong>Directory Information</strong>. MSSM
                  may make directory information (as described in the
                  Definitions section) public at its discretion unless a
                  parent/eligible student has notified the
                  Superintendent in writing by September 15th or within
                  thirty (30) days of enrollment, whichever is
                  later.</p>
                  <p>MSSM may disclose directory information about
                  former students without the consent of the
                  parent/eligible student.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Military Recruiters/Institutions of
                  Higher Education</strong>. Military recruiters and
                  institutions of higher education are entitled to
                  receive the names, addresses and telephone numbers of
                  secondary students, and MSSM must comply with any such
                  request, provided that parents have been notified of
                  their right to request that this information not be
                  released without their prior written consent.
                  Parents/eligible students who do not want MSSM to
                  disclose this information must notify the
                  Superintendent in writing by September 15th or within
                  thirty (30) days of enrollment, whichever is
                  later.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>School Officials with Legitimate
                  Educational Interests</strong>. Education records may
                  be disclosed to School officials with a “legitimate
                  educational interest.” A School official has a
                  legitimate educational interest if he/she needs to
                  review an education record in order to fulfill his/her
                  professional responsibility. School officials include
                  person employed by MSSM as an administrator,
                  supervisor, instructor or support staff member
                  (including health or medical staff and MSSM’s
                  designated law enforcement personnel, if any); members
                  of the Board of Education; persons or companies with
                  whom MSSM has contracted to provides specific services
                  (such as attorneys, auditors, medical consultants,
                  evaluators or therapists); and parents, students or
                  volunteers serving on an official committee (such as a
                  disciplinary or grievance committee) or assisting a
                  School official in performing his/her professional
                  responsibilities.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Other Schools</strong>. Under Maine law
                  (20-A M.R.S.A. § 6001-B), MSSM is required to send a
                  student’s education records to a School to which a
                  student applies for a transfer, including disciplinary
                  records, attendance records, special education records
                  and health records. Consent is not required for the
                  transfer of these records, except for confidential
                  health records. At the request of the Superintendent
                  of the School where a student seeks admission, the
                  student’s current or former School administrators
                  shall provide, in a timely fashion, an oral or written
                  report to the Superintendent indicating whether the
                  student has been expelled or suspended or is the
                  subject of an expulsion or suspension
                  proceeding.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Other Entities/Individuals</strong>.
                  Education records may be disclosed to other
                  governmental entities and individuals as specifically
                  permitted by FERPA and the accompanying
                  regulations.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Information on the Internet</strong>.
                  Under Maine law (20-A M.R.S.A. § 6001), MSSM shall not
                  publish on the Internet any information that
                  identifies a student, including but not limited to the
                  student’s full name, photograph, personal biography,
                  e-mail address, home address, date of birth, social
                  security number and parents’ names, without written
                  parental consent.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p><strong>WAIVER OF CONFIDENTIALITY
                  RIGHTS</strong></p>
                  <p>A parent/eligible student may waive any of his/her
                  rights regarding confidentiality of educational
                  records, but any such a waiver must be in writing and
                  signed by the parent/eligible student. The School may
                  not require that a parent/eligible student waive his
                  or her rights. Any waiver may be revoked with respect
                  to actions occurring after the revocation. If a parent
                  executes a waiver, that waiver may be revoked by the
                  student any time after he/she becomes an eligible
                  student.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>FEES FOR COPYING RECORDS</strong></p>
                  <p>There shall be no charge to search for or retrieve
                  education records of a student. MSSM shall provide
                  copies of education records to parents/eligible
                  students upon request. The cost of producing copies of
                  the record to the parents/eligible student will be ten
                  cents ($0.10) per page copied, plus postage.
                  Parents/eligible students who are unable to pay such
                  fees will not be denied access to education
                  records.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>MAINTENANCE AND DESTRUCTION OF
                  EDUCATION RECORDS</strong></p>
                  <p>MSSM shall maintain accurate and up-to-date
                  education records as required by federal and state
                  statutes and regulations.</p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p>Records shall be maintained by personnel who
                  are knowledgeable about the applicable
                  confidentiality. All records shall be safeguarded from
                  unauthorized access. Student records must be kept in a
                  fireproof storage at the School or a duplicate set
                  kept off-site.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The high School transcripts of all former
                  students shall be kept in perpetuity by MSSM. A
                  permanent record of a special education student’s
                  name, address, phone number, grades, attendance
                  record, classes attended, and grade and year completed
                  shall be maintained without time limitations. All
                  other records will be maintained in accordance with
                  Maine State Rules for Disposition of Local Government
                  Records (Schedule L).</p></li>
                  <li><p>MSSM shall not destroy any education record if
                  there is any outstanding request to inspect or review
                  such records.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Records of access to education records shall be
                  retained as long as the records themselves.</p></li>
                  <li><p>MSSM shall inform parents of students with
                  disabilities when education records are no longer
                  needed to provide educational services to the student
                  or to demonstrate that the School has provided the
                  student with a free appropriate public education as
                  required by law. At that point, the records may be
                  turned over to parent/eligible student upon their
                  request, or destroyed in accordance with the parent’s
                  request or MSSM procedures.</p></li>
