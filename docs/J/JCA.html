                  <p>The Maine School of Science and Mathematics will
                  strive to:</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>foster a learning environment that is safe,
                  affirming, and free from discrimination, harassment

                  <li><p>assist in the educational and social
                  integration and development of transgender and gender
                  nonconforming students in our schools. This policy is
                  intended to be interpreted in light of applicable
                  federal and state laws and regulations, as well as
                  Board policies, procedures, and school rules. This
                  policy is not intended to anticipate every possible
                  situation that may occur, since the needs of
                  particular students differ. Administrators and school
                  staff are expected to utilize this policy within the
                  context of the individual needs of the
                  student.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>Definitions</p>
                  <p>The following definitions are not intended to
                  provide rigid labels for students, but to assist in
                  discussing and addressing the needs of students.
                  Administrators, school staff, volunteers, students,
                  and others who interact with students are expected to
                  be sensitive to the ways in which particular
                  transgender and gender nonconforming students may wish
                  to be identified.</p>

                  functional differences between people’s bodies that
                  are generally related to the expression of genes
                  located on the X and Y sex chromosomes.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Gender Assigned at Birth - Male, female,
                  intersex or other such designation given to a person,
                  typically by a doctor, nurse, midwife or other medical
                  professional when a person is born. This designation
                  may be based on anatomical or other characteristics of
                  the person’s biological sex.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Gender Expression - The manner in which a
                  person represents or expresses gender to others, often
                  through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, activities,
                  voice, or mannerisms.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Gender Identity - A person’s deeply held
                  knowledge of their own gender, which can include being
                  female, male, another gender, or no gender. Gender
                  identity encompasses how individuals perceive
                  themselves and what they call themselves. One’s gender
                  identity can be the same or different than the gender
                  assigned at birth.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Gender Nonconforming - A term sometimes used to
                  describe people whose gender expression differs from
                  social expectations, such as “feminine boys,”
                  “masculine girls,” and people who are perceived as
                  androgynous in some way. Being gender nonconforming is
                  distinct from being transgender, though some trans
                  people may consider themselves to be gender
                  nonconforming,</p></li>
                  <li><p>Legal Gender - An individual’s gender as
                  recorded on such legal documents as a birth record,
                  driver’s license, or other state or federally issued
                  identification. This is distinct from an individual’s
                  gender identity. In Maine law, the term gender marker
                  is used to indicate the user’s gender in certain legal
                  documents. In Maine, gender markers include M (Male),
                  F (Female), and X (non-binary).</p></li>
                  <li><p>Preferred Name - A name that may differ from a
                  student’s legal name, which is to be used by the staff
                  and students at the school when communicating with or
                  about that student. Note that in some cases, the
                  student may request that staff and students use the
                  student’s legal name or other name when communicating
                  with people outside of the school, including when
                  communicating with parents, guardians, or other family
                  members. A preferred name is sometimes referred to as
                  a chosen name.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Sexual Orientation - A person’s romantic and/or
                  physical attraction to people of the same and/or
                  another gender, such as being straight, gay, bisexual,
                  or asexual.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Transgender - An adjective describing a person
                  whose gender identity and/or expression is different
                  from cultural expectations based on the sex/gender
                  they were assigned at birth. Being transgender does
                  not imply any specific sexual orientation.</p></li>

                  <li><p>Addressing the Needs of Transgender and Gender
                  Nonconforming Students</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>The Maine School of Science and Mathematics
                  (MSSM) is committed to addressing the needs of
                  transgender and gender nonconforming students. As with
                  all students, if a transgender or gender nonconforming
                  student needs additional support, the student and/or
                  the parent or guardian may contact school personnel in
                  order to make an individual plan for the student. An
                  individual support plan aims to engage the student,
                  and possibly the parent or guardian, in creating a
                  supportive plan that reflects and responds to the
                  individual needs of the student in the school
                  community. The administration will develop procedures
                  for staff to follow to provide support for transgender
                  students. School staff shall comply with any plan
                  developed for a transgender student.</p></li>
                  <li><p>MSSM shall accept a student’s assertion of
                  their gender identity when there is consistent
                  assertion of gender identity or any other evidence
                  that the student’s gender identity is sincerely held
                  as a part of their core identity. MSSM will not
                  require medical or mental health records as proof of a
                  student’s gender identity.</p></li>
                  <li><p>If MSSM has a credible and objective reason to
                  believe that a transgender or gender nonconforming
                  student’s gender identity is being asserted for an
                  improper purpose, the institution may seek additional
                  clarification about the student’s needs and
                  objectives.</p></li>
                  <li><p>In the event that the student and their
                  parent/legal guardian do not agree as to the student’s
                  gender identity, or gender expression, MSSM shall,
                  whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student
                  with regard to their gender identity and expression
                  while at school. The school shall develop a plan along
                  with the student to best support the student and their
                  ability to be themself in the school environment,
                  while at the same time minimizing any additional
                  stress, conflict, or danger posed by such
                  disagreement.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>Policy on Specific Issues</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>Privacy and Confidentiality: MSSM shall ensure
                  that student records shall be kept confidential in
                  accordance with applicable state, local and federal
                  privacy laws. School staff shall comply with the
                  student’s wishes regarding disclosure to others of
                  their transgender status, legal name, legal gender,
                  preferred name, gender identity, pronouns, and gender
                  assigned at birth unless students have explicitly
                  authorized the disclosure. Examples of exceptions to
                  this rule include, but are not limited to, FERPA
                  required disclosures, use of a student’s legal name
                  for billing or on transcripts, or in medical
                  situations where the individual’s biological sex is
                  relevant. Note that in the case of transgender status,
                  preferred name, gender identity, and pronouns, this
                  includes complying with the student’s wishes regarding
                  disclosure to parents and guardians.</p></li>
                  <li><p>School Records: MSSM shall maintain a permanent
                  record for each student which includes their legal
                  name and legal gender. In addition, at the request of
                  a student, MSSM shall also maintain a record of the
                  student’s preferred name, pronouns, and gender
                  identity. The legal name included in the student’s
                  record may be changed only upon proof that it has been
                  changed pursuant to a court order.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Preferred Names: Any student at MSSM may
                  request a preferred name to be used in place of their
                  legal name within the school community provided that
                  it is a name they use consistently in both academic
                  and residential settings. In accordance with the
                  wishes of the student, this name will be used
                  everywhere possible: in printed documentation, verbal
                  communication among both staff and students, and in
                  electronic information systems. This includes, but is
                  not limited to school identification, classroom
                  rosters, and yearbooks. At the request of the student
                  their legal name will be kept private to the extent
                  allowed by FERPA and other laws and
                  regulations.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Pronouns: Any student at MSSM may notify the
                  school of their choice of pronouns to be used at the
                  school, provided those pronouns are used consistently
                  within the school setting. In accordance with the
                  wishes of the student, these pronouns will be used
                  everywhere possible: in printed documentation, verbal
                  communication among both staff and students, and
                  electronic information systems.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Housing and Roommates: Students and their
                  parents may express preferences as to the location of
                  housing and the selection of roommates based either on
                  the student’s biological sex or on their gender
                  identity. MSSM will make all reasonable attempts to
                  accommodate those preferences within the constraints
                  imposed by state and federal laws.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Restrooms, Locker Rooms and Other
                  Gender-Segregated Facilities: Students shall be
                  permitted to use restrooms, locker rooms, and changing
                  facilities corresponding to their gender identity. The
                  school will provide reasonable alternative facilities
                  such as a separate stall or a staff facility in
                  accordance with a student preference for greater
                  privacy. A student shall not be required to use a
                  separate, non-communal facility over their
                  objection.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Gender-Segregated Facilities or Activities: As
                  a general matter, MSSM should try to avoid
                  gender-based activities, policies, and practices
                  except where they serve an important educational
                  purpose. In other facilities, activities, policies, or
                  practices when students may be separated by gender,
                  students shall be able to participate in accordance
                  with the gender identity asserted at school.
                  Interscholastic athletic activities should be
                  addressed through the Maine Principals Association
                  Transgender Participation Policy, and school staff
                  will support students navigating the eligibility
                  process to try to ensure a respectful and supportive
                  process for the students.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Dress Code: Any dress code instituted at MSSM
                  shall, as much as possible, be gender neutral and
                  apply equally to all students. Students must dress
                  consistently with any applicable requirements in the
                  dress code or school rules.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Discrimination: School staff should be
                  sensitive to the fact that transgender students are at
                  higher risk for discrimination, harassment, and
                  bullying and should immediately notify the Title IX
                  Coordinator or other administrator (according to the
                  policies listed below) if they become aware of a
                  problem. Discrimination, harassment, and bullying of
                  students based on sex, sexual orientation, gender
                  identity, and gender expression are prohibited by
                  Title IX, the Maine Human Rights Act, and by MSSM
                  Policies including policies AC, ACAA, ACAA-R, and
                  JICK.</p></li>
