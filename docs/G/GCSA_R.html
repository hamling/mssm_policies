                  <h1 class="title">Procedure for Official Social Media
Accounts</h1>
                  <p>Maine School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM)
                  recognizes the importance and benefits of
                  communicating through social media. Social media is a
                  powerful vehicle through which MSSM may disseminate
                  relevant news to its community, listen to voices and
                  perceptions of MSSM, connect with our audiences
                  online, and build goodwill. Social networks and other
                  online media are great tools for engagement and
                  two-way communication, but there is the potential for
                  significant risks associated with inappropriate use.
                  Existing legal responsibilities and school policies
                  remain in place when MSSM employees use social
                  media.</p>
                  <h2 id="audience-for-this-procedure">Audience for this
                  Procedure</h2>
                  <p>This procedure is intended for all students,
                  faculty and staff who manage or contribute to official
                  MSSM social media channels, which are defined as
                  channels that speak on behalf of the school and have
                  some oversight by MSSM staff. These include, but are
                  not limited to, channels for schools, academic
                  departments and offices at MSSM. Social media channels
                  can include blogs, wikis, and social networks (eg.
                  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn,
                  etc.).</p>
                  <p>This procedure does not pertain to the personal use
                  of social media by students, staff and faculty
                  members. See policy on the personal use of social
                  media for all MSSM employees. (Section G: Personnel -
                  GCSB Social Media use by School Employees)</p>
                  <h2
                  id="policy-for-official-social-media-accounts-at-mssm">Policy
                  for Official Social Media Accounts at MSSM</h2>
                  <p>This policy applies to all MSSM students, faculty,
                  staff, trustees, and official school entities. This
                  includes anyone managing or contributing to a social
                  media channel on behalf of the school, academic
                  department, office or other official entity at the
                  school. Social media channels can include blogs,
                  wikis, social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter,
                  YouTube, LinkedIn, etc.), and other media yet to be
                  developed in a dynamic communications field. This
                  policy only applies to those individuals when they are
                  posting on such official sites and/or when they
                  otherwise speak as an authorized representative of the
                  school. It does not apply to other social media
                  communications and postings that such individuals may
                  make on personal social media sites so long as such
                  communications do not indicate that the individual is
                  speaking on behalf of MSSM. (Section G: Personnel -
                  GCSB Social Media use by School Employees)</p>
                  <h2 id="authorized-users">Authorized Users</h2>
                  <p>All official MSSM social media accounts shall be
                  documented and administered by the Executive
                  Director’s designee. Other authorized users may be
                  assigned to an official MSSM social media account with
                  prior approval of the Executive Director.</p>
                  <h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>
                  <p>Do not post confidential or proprietary information
                  about MSSM, or MSSM employees, students, affiliates,
                  or alumni that would violate such persons’ rights to
                  privacy under applicable federal and state laws and
                  regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability
                  and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the Family
                  Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA) and school
                  policies. Non-disclosure agreements that prohibit the
                  school from disclosing information also bind its
                  employees from disclosing such information.</p>
                  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
                  <p>Do not post anything to an official social media
                  channel that should not be shared publicly. In
                  particular, do not discuss a situation involving named
                  or pictured individuals on a social media site without
                  their knowledge or permission. This does not include
                  photos from the MSSM Digital Collections and Archives
                  or photos in which individuals are not clearly
                  recognizable. Keep in mind that for reasons of privacy
                  or security some students may not want it publicly
                  known that they attend MSSM. Never share Social
                  Security numbers, addresses or other private
                  information. Remember that whatever you share may be
                  public for an indefinite period of time, even if you
                  attempt to modify or delete it.</p>
                  <h2 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h2>
                  <p>Use of social media on an official MSSM channel
                  must be managed responsibly because it reflects on the
                  school, its faculty, students, alumni, and
                  employees.</p>
                  <p>Emergencies and Crisis Situations: In the event of
                  an emergency or crisis situation, managers of official
                  MSSM accounts are asked to share only official
                  information provided by or shared in official school
                  messages. Sharing information found online or not
                  approved by MSSM may lead to false or confusing
                  information reaching the community and spreading
                  online. Official accounts are also asked to delete or
                  postpone any previously scheduled tweets or posts
                  during an emergency or crisis situation.</p>
                  <p>Other Users: Other users, including student groups
                  at MSSM, may have different interests, attitudes and
                  opinions than official MSSM social media accounts.
                  Before retweeting or sharing, on official school
                  channels, content posted by others, be careful that
                  such content is accurate and reflects the school’s
                  position.</p>
                  <p>Correcting Information: If you unintentionally post
                  something online that is incorrect, correct it visibly
                  and publicly as quickly as possible. Doing so will
                  earn you respect in the online community.</p>
                  <h2 id="transparency">Transparency</h2>
                  <p>To both protect the MSSM name and build trust with
                  users, social media such as blogs, Facebook pages,
                  Twitter feeds, etc. that are established on behalf of
                  MSSM entities should be explicit regarding the nature
                  of the relationship of such media to MSSM. Similarly,
                  in keeping with MSSM’s non-profit and public entity
                  status, social media should not be used for any
                  private business or financial transactions including
                  revenue from advertising, nor should any staff with
                  administrative responsibilities realize any personal
                  monetary profit from MSSM-related social media. Social
                  media may be used for fundraising for the MSSM
                  Foundation as long as a transaction does not occur on
                  the social media platform itself without prior
                  approval from the Executive Director/designee.</p>
                  <p>Content shared via official MSSM social media
                  channels, as well as pages or accounts that these
                  channels like or follow, should reflect the mission
                  and values of MSSM. Official MSSM accounts should
                  refrain from posting content and liking or following
                  users or pages that reflect personal interests or that
                  may be in conflict with MSSM’s mission or values.
                  Official MSSM accounts should encourage engagement and
                  interaction with and among followers; however, they
                  should reserve the right to remove content that is
                  spam, commercial, obscene, harassing, or derogatory.
                  If the social network allows for it in the “Bio” or
                  “About” section, official accounts should post a
                  disclaimer similar to this: “Third-party posts on this
                  wall do not imply endorsement of that content by MSSM.
                  We reserve the right to remove content.”</p>
                  <h2 id="comment-and-response">Comment and
                  Response</h2>
                  <p>Many social media sites permit and invite posts and
                  comments by site users. By permitting use of this
                  feature, the school does not intend to create a
                  general public forum, and all comments and posts must
                  comply with this policy. MSSM Terms of Use, as set

                  policy.</p>
                  <p>Any employee authorized to post on MSSM social
                  media pages shall use his or her best judgment in
                  deciding whether or not to respond to a post or
                  comment, and shall avoid engaging any user in an
                  argumentative or offensive manner. Content in any post
                  or response made on behalf of MSSM shall not
                  specifically refer to any MSSM vendor, supplier, or
                  contractor without the approval of the Executive
                  Director.</p>
                  <h2 id="use-of-the-mssm-name">Use of the MSSM
                  Name</h2>
                  <p>In addition to meeting the requirements set forth
                  in the Guidelines on the use of MSSM’s names and
                  insignias, there are unique challenges associated with
                  using the MSSM name in social media, such as the
                  potential need to abbreviate a program or entity name
                  for a Twitter account.</p>
                  <p>Use of the MSSM seal or wordmark as a profile photo
                  on any unofficial Facebook, Twitter, or other social
                  media account is not allowed. Be as clear as possible
                  when naming your social media accounts, while keeping
                  in mind character limits. Avoid using acronyms that
                  may not be universally recognized.</p>
                  <h2 id="copyright">Copyright</h2>
                  <p>MSSM official accounts must follow the MSSM Policy
                  EGAD when posting intellectual property, including
                  photos and videos, online.</p>
                  <p>Materials posted online should be your property, in
                  the public domain, have a Creative Commons license, or
                  fall under fair use. For all other instances, you
                  should seek permission from the copyright holder.</p>
                  <p>Photos from MSSM should only be posted with
                  permission from the Photo’s owner. Where possible,
                  best practice is to include credit/attribution.</p>
                  <h2 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h2>
                  <p>Official social media accounts at MSSM must follow
                  the Terms of Service set forth by the social media
                  channels they are using.</p>
                  <h2 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h2>
                  <p>MSSM has created best practices and guidelines for
                  the most popular social media platforms.</p>
                  <p>Official channels should follow the best practices
                  for each platform. In some cases, deviation from best
                  practices is warranted, but failure to follow best
                  practices to the detriment of the school may result
                  in, but not be limited to, exclusion from official
                  MSSM social media lists or platforms, lack of
                  promotion from the main MSSM channels, and possible
                  deactivation or deletion of their official
                  administrative rights or offending accounts.
                  Deactivation and deletion will be carried out by
                  contacting and working with the school’s Executive
                  Director or their designee.</p>
                  <h2 id="list-of-active-accounts">List of Active
                  Accounts</h2>
                  <p>The Executive Director or their designee will
                  maintain a list of all active social media accounts,
                  their log-ins and passwords which will be kept with
                  the IT Department.</p>
                  <h2 id="inactive-accounts">Inactive Accounts</h2>
                  <p>Social media channels at MSSM must be continually
                  updated and monitored. Accounts that have been
                  inactive for more than one month may be subject to
                  deactivation or deletion. Deactivation and deletion
                  will be carried out by contacting and working with the
                  Executive Director or their designee.</p>
                  <h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
                  <p>MSSM is committed to ensuring effective access to
                  communications materials for all members of the school
                  community, including individuals with
                  disabilities.</p>
                  <p>Visually impaired individuals and those with other
                  disabilities may confront significant barriers when
                  accessing certain information through social media.
                  MSSM employees will, to all extent possible, follow
                  the guidelines put out by the W3C (<a
                  href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/"

                  <h2 id="personnel-recruitment">Personnel
                  Recruitment</h2>
                  <p>While social media continues to evolve and develop
                  as an effective tool for advertising jobs at the
                  school and for recruiting candidates, it does not
                  replace or otherwise eliminate the need to use the
                  school’s existing recruitment systems and processes
                  for posting positions, collecting applications,
                  conducting background checks, making offers of
                  employment and other related activities. Offers of
                  employment should only be extended through existing
                  and accepted processes, and should not be communicated
                  through social media.</p>
