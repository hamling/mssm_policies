                  <li><p><strong>Policy Overview and
                  Definitions</strong></p>
                  <p>This policy addresses the ownership of Intellectual
                  Property (IP) for works developed or created by
                  members of the Maine School of Science and Mathematics
                  (MSSM) community, including faculty, staff, and
                  students, and the circumstances and processes under
                  which agreements and determinations of ownership are
                  reached. The policy applies to Intellectual Property
                  developed or created by members of the School
                  community or with School resources.</p>
                  <p>Scholarly work created by faculty or students is IP
                  and is normally owned by the creator(s). Scholarly
                  work is defined broadly to include pedagogical,
                  literary, scientific, and other creative work
                  developed by faculty members and/or students or staff
                  members acting outside the scope of their employment.
                  This includes (1) work related to scholarship, such as
                  books, journal articles, inventions, advances,
                  discoveries, software, creative works, artistic works
                  in any medium including, but not limited to, musical
                  composition, choreography, visual art, scriptwriting,
                  videos and photographs, and (2) work related to
                  teaching, such as textbooks, lecture notes and other
                  course notes whether in summary or verbatim form,
                  whether privately held by the faculty member or
                  distributed to the class, whether paper or electronic,
                  problem sets, syllabi, training materials, and Web
                  sites for classes. This means that the vast majority
                  of scholarly work generated by faculty and/or students
                  is IP that is owned exclusively by the creator(s).
                  Exceptions may arise in circumstances involving
                  identity interest, functional interest, or exceptional
                  use of School resources, as described below. IP
                  created by School staff within the scope or course of
                  their employment, on the other hand, is owned by the
                  School.</p>
                  <p>MSSM has an ownership interest in IP if it involves
                  (i) an identity interest, (ii) a functional interest,
                  or (iii) exceptional use of School resources.</p>
                  <ol type="i">
                  <li><p>The School has an “<em>identity interest</em>”
                  in works that are integral to, and reflect more
                  directly on, the identity of the School than on the
                  identity of the individual(s) who create them. For
                  example, the School has an identity interest in items
                  disseminated by and for the School, such as various
                  School catalogs, institutional Web pages, alumni
                  bulletins, admissions brochures, and fundraising
                  materials. An identity interest also occurs when there
                  is a prominent use of the School’s name, or of any
                  image, trademark or logo of the School (See the
                  School’s Web policy). Simply identifying the author of
                  a work as an MSSM instructor would not be considered
                  prominent use of the School’s name. Faculty members
                  who intend to utilize the School’s identity in
                  creating IP must discuss ownership of the product as
                  early as possible in the product’s development with
                  the Executive Director. Determination of ownership
                  must be reached prior to its distribution.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The School has a “<em>functional interest</em>”
                  in works that are used to enhance the effective
                  functioning and coordination of ongoing operations of
                  the School, or in which the School has a contractual
                  or legal obligation. For example, the School has a
                  functional interest in administrative and personnel
                  procedures, including software, and internal
                  handbooks, and reports. The School has a functional
                  interest in IP created with federal or other outside
                  funds which carry an obligation that the School retain
                  certain IP rights or assign them to another party
                  outside the School. Certain collaborative agreements
                  also require the School to negotiate IP rights with
                  other entities, creating a functional interest. If the
                  School has a functional interest, the IP is owned by
                  the School.</p></li>
                  <li><p>“<em>Exceptional use of School resources</em>”
                  for faculty and/or student work means that the School
                  has provided funding, facilities, or staff support of
                  a degree or nature not typically made available.
                  Ordinary use of desktop computers or the School
                  library, routine support from the School’s staff, or
                  use of School office space does not constitute
                  exceptional use of School resources. In addition, the
                  School’s provision of standard labs and studios,
                  funding of sabbatical leaves, and funding provided to
                  support scholarly work (e.g., start-up funds and
                  annual faculty development grants) are typically not
                  considered to be exceptional use of School resources.
                  In the instance that a faculty member expects to be
                  provided, or the School expects to provide,
                  exceptional and atypical support, a contractual
                  agreement or formal determination should be reached in
                  advance of such funding and allocation of resources,
                  fixing the extent, if any, of School ownership of IP
                  that may result from the work (See Section III of this
                  Policy).</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p><strong>Policy for Faculty, Staff, and
                  Students</strong></p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p>Faculty</p>
                  <p>Scholarly works created by members of the faculty
                  and all the intellectual property rights associated
                  with them remain with the creator(s) unless the School
                  has an identity or functional interest or the work is
                  created by, with, or through exceptional use of School
                  resources. If there is an identity or functional
                  interest, the School owns the rights to the IP. For
                  instance, the School has a functional interest in
                  faculty administrative work, such as committee reports
                  and departmental or institutional records. When
                  faculty members contribute to School publications, the
                  work is owned by the School because of the identity
                  and functional interest in the work.</p>
                  <p>While the IP ownership of work related to teaching
                  and scholarly activities rests with the faculty
                  member, the School has a functional interest in its
                  ongoing instructional operations. By teaching at the
                  School, faculty members grant a non-exclusive
                  perpetual license to the School to use and modify
                  curricular and instructional materials they develop at
                  the School.</p>
                  <p>The School may have an ownership interest in common
                  with the creator(s) in faculty work that involves
                  exceptional use of School resources, including
                  substantial use of other School employees. The
                  ownership, use, and development of such IP will be
                  governed by mutual agreement between the creator(s)
                  and the School, or if an agreement cannot be reached
                  between the creator(s) and the School, by a
                  determination made under the procedures of Section III
                  of this Policy.</p>
                  <p>Faculty members are expected to acknowledge
                  assistance or co-authorship when appropriate.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Staff</p>
                  <p>The legal principle embodied in copyright law known
                  as “work made for hire” provides that all work created
                  by employees within the scope or course of their
                  employment belongs to the employer. The School has
                  both functional and identity interests in IP developed
                  by staff members, and could not function if it had to
                  negotiate the right to use work produced by individual
                  staff members. Following standard and typical
                  employment practice, the School owns all IP developed
                  by staff members within the scope or course of their
                  employment. If an individual is hired as both a member
                  of the staff and the faculty, the determination of IP
                  rights depends upon the relation of the IP to the
                  scope of employment of each job. IP that is created by
                  members of the staff outside the scope or course of
                  their employment is the property of the staff
                  member.</p>
                  <p>Staff members must discuss with their supervisor,
                  in advance, any situations in which they intend to
                  claim ownership of any IP that could be construed as
                  being within the scope or course of their employment.
                  The ownership, use, and development of such IP will be
                  governed by mutual agreement between the creator(s)
                  and the School, or if an agreement cannot be reached
                  between the creator(s) and the School, by a
                  determination made under the procedures of Section III
                  of this Policy.</p>
                  <p>When IP is created by staff members working
                  directly with members of the faculty or with students,
                  the School has an interest in the IP. For example,
                  when a programmer in Computer Science develops
                  software in collaboration with or at the request of a
                  faculty member, the School owns the software written
                  by the staff member.</p>
                  <p>Staff members are expected to acknowledge
                  assistance or co-authorship when appropriate.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Students</p>
                  <p>Scholarly works generated by students in their
                  capacity as students are owned by the students who
                  created them. In addition, the Family Educational
                  Rights and Privacy Act gives students certain privacy
                  rights over personally identifiable information
                  possessed by the School. Course-related materials,
                  assignments, and other similar materials in students’
                  possession may also include IP of faculty members.
                  Students who consider distributing such materials to
                  others should be aware that they may not have property
                  rights to all the materials in their possession, such
                  as course syllabi, copies of lectures, or other IP of
                  faculty members.</p>
                  <p>Students who are employed by the School are subject
                  to IP policies for staff (see Section II.B.)</p>
                  <p>Students are expected to acknowledge assistance or
                  co-authorship when appropriate.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Grants, Sponsored Works, and Specially Funded
                  Works.</p>
                  <p>Many grants and contracts from government agencies
                  or private sponsors contain provisions governing
                  intellectual property and/or other rights to the
                  property which obligate the grantee (the School) in
                  some way. In such cases, the School has a functional
                  interest in the IP and owns all relevant property
                  rights associated with the IP. The School will assure
                  that IP restrictions are accounted for in grant
                  application and administrative processes associated
                  with it. Principal investigators are required to
                  comply with any such restrictions, including reporting
                  requirements. Policy DD - GRANTS must be consulted in
                  advance of any grant application regarding such
                  restrictions (see Section III.A).</p></li>

                  <li><p><strong>Process for Determination of Ownership
                  of Intellectual Property</strong></p>
                  <p>In the vast majority of cases, application of the
                  foregoing principles will be straightforward and there
                  will be no question about who owns the rights to the
                  IP. In such cases, the party with rights (a faculty
                  member, staff member, student, or the School) will
                  decide the uses of the IP and will receive any income
                  associated with it. All questions about whether a
                  project involves exceptional use of School resources,
                  or whether a functional or identity interest of the
                  School may exist should be referred to the Executive
                  Director. The Executive Director in consultation with
                  the creator(s) and appropriate School administrators
                  will endeavor to reach an agreement with the
                  creator(s) regarding the ownership, use, and
                  development of the IP. Agreements will be deposited in
                  the employee’s or student’s file according to the
                  procedures established in Section VI.D. If no
                  agreement is reached, the Executive Director will make
                  a determination (See Section III.B).</p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p>Reporting.</p>
                  <p>The uniform application of this Policy requires
                  that the School be made aware of IP created by members
                  of the School community with the use of School
                  resources. Responsibility for reporting the creation
                  of IP rests with the creator(s). The Executive
                  Director/designee will develop a procedure that will
                  facilitate such reporting.</p>
                  <p>In cases where the IP is a scholarly work created
                  by a faculty member or staff member outside the scope
                  of his or her employment and no identity or functional
                  interest is involved, no reporting is required.
                  Routine professional activities reports would suffice
                  and are typically submitted after the fact. Scholarly
                  work created by students in their capacity as students
                  need not be reported. Certain cases must be addressed
                  specifically to the Executive Director. Creator(s)
                  should report, as soon as the situation is reasonably
                  clear and before work is well underway, on the
                  production or planned production of any IP that meets
                  one or more of the following conditions:</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>The IP involves or has the potential for
                  involving a functional or identity interest of the
                  School.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Production of the IP involves or may involve
                  exceptional use of School resources.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The IP is produced with Federal or other
                  outside funds which impose ownership, reporting or
                  other requirements on the School or the creator(s). In
                  such cases, reporting may be required within specified
                  time limits, which must be observed.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The IP is jointly created by faculty and
                  staff.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The IP is created in a collaborative
                  relationship with another entity requiring that
                  entity’s IP interests be reconciled with those of the
                  School.</p></li>
                  <li><p>A creator intends to seek a patent on or
                  otherwise commercialize the IP, in which case, the
                  process of protection or commercialization may involve
                  substantial cost and effort, and the creator(s) may
                  wish the School to consider providing some or all of
                  that support and share the net rewards, liabilities,
                  or risks with the School.</p></li>
                  <li><p>The creator is a staff member who intends to
                  claim ownership of IP that could be construed as being
                  within the scope or course of employment at the
                  School.</p></li>
                  <li><p>A creator has any question about ownership or
                  other rights in the IP.</p></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>In the case of a group IP project, all those in the
                  group shall be named in the report and if the report
                  contains an initial proposal for the disposition of
                  rights and proceeds, all members of the group shall
                  sign.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Determination process.</p>
                  <p>When a report is required under Section III.A. and
                  no agreement with the creator(s) is reached, the
                  Executive Director, in consultation with the
                  creator(s) and appropriate administrators, shall make
                  a determination whether the IP involves a functional
                  or identity interest; whether its creation involves
                  exceptional use of School resources; or whether the
                  work is created within the scope or course of
                  employment of a staff member at the School. The
                  Executive Director shall make a determination of
                  ownership of the IP and associated intellectual
                  property rights, responsibilities, and use rights of
                  the School and the creator(s), and, if appropriate,
                  how the School will recoup its costs and share in
                  financial gains from the IP. This determination shall
                  be made in a timely manner. In all cases, the
                  Executive Director will be guided by the principles
                  set forth in this policy and the creator(s) will be
                  given an opportunity to explain the situation or
                  proposal and recommend terms for ownership,
                  responsibilities, use rights, risks, and financial
                  arrangements.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Written Determination</p>
                  <p>The Executive Director’s determination shall be
                  made in writing and signed by the Executive Director.
                  The determination shall contain provisions outlining
                  the allocation of ownership, interests, use rights,
                  responsibilities, risks, and a mechanism for the
                  sharing of net proceeds, if any, and other rights
                  between the creator(s) and the School. The Executive
                  Director will cause the written determination, once
                  made, to be delivered promptly to the creator(s). The
                  determination, bearing the date on which it was
                  delivered to the creator(s), shall be filed with and
                  maintained in the Business Office of the School. The
                  determination shall become final and shall be binding
                  on the creator(s) and the School unless, within thirty
                  (30) days of the date on which the Executive Director
                  has delivered the determination to the creator(s), the
                  creator(s) file a notice of appeal of the Executive
                  Director’s determination with the Executive
                  Director.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Appeals</p>
                  <p>On receipt of a notice of appeal, an ad hoc
                  committee of MSSM faculty or staff members shall be
                  formed by a board member appointed by the chair of the
                  Board of Trustees, not including the Executive
                  Director, faculty representative, or student
                  representative. The ad hoc committee shall be
                  comprised of one individual selected by the Executive
                  Director, one individual selected by the creator(s),
                  and the appointed board member. The committee shall
                  review the Executive Director’s determination, the
                  position of the Executive Director and the creator(s),
                  and the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding
                  the IP, and will make a written recommendation to the
                  Board of Trustees not later than sixty (60) days
                  following the date of receipt of the notice of appeal.
                  The Board of Trustees, after review of the
                  recommendation of the ad hoc committee, shall issue a
                  determination within thirty (30) days of receipt of
                  the ad hoc committee recommendation. The Board of
                  Trustees’ determination will be filed with the
                  Business Office of the School and a copy will be
                  delivered to the creator(s). This determination of the
                  Board of Trustees will be final and will be binding
                  upon the School and the creator(s).</p></li>
                  <li><p>Time</p>
                  <p>The Board of Trustees, on application by either the
                  Executive Director or the creator(s) or on the Board
                  of Trustees’ independent initiative, shall have the
                  authority to modify the time requirements of this
                  Section III for good cause.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Executive Director as Creator</p>
                  <p>In the event that the Executive Director is a
                  creator or co-creator of IP as to which no agreement
                  has been reached and which requires a determination
                  under this Section III, the process described in
                  subsections A, B, C, D, and E of this Section III
                  shall not apply as to that IP. The determination shall
                  instead be made by the Chair of the Board of Trustees
                  of the School. The Chair’s determination, when
                  ratified by majority vote of the Board of Trustees,
                  shall be final and shall be binding upon the
                  creator(s) and the School.</p></li>

                  School:</strong></p>
                  <p>The School anticipates that even when IP is clearly
                  the property of individuals, those individuals may
                  wish to transfer rights to the School in exchange for
                  help in developing; disseminating; or protecting their
                  creations.</p>
                  <p>Requests by members of the School community for
                  such an exchange will be addressed on a case-by-case
                  basis.</p>
                  <p>As stated in II.A., faculty members grant a
                  non-exclusive perpetual license to the School to use
                  and modify curricular and instructional materials
                  developed at the School.</p></li>

                  <p>IP developed by students, faculty, and staff
                  members without the use of School resources or outside
                  the scope or course of employment at the School is not
                  governed by this Policy, unless it involves an
                  identity interest of the School. For instance, a
                  report provided to another organization in a
                  consulting role is IP created through outside
                  employment. Faculty members should be guided in
                  accepting any outside employment by the Faculty
                  Handbook. Staff members should be guided by MSSM
                  policies on conflict of interest and outside
                  employment as outlined in the Employee
                  Handbook.</p></li>
