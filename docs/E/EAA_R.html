BUS DRIVERS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE</h1>
                  <p>The Maine School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM)
                  Board of Trustees, hereinafter referred to as the
                  “Board,” is committed to the establishment of an
                  alcohol and controlled substance testing program that
                  meets all applicable requirements of the federal
                  Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991,
                  in addition to pertinent state laws and regulations.
                  The purpose of the testing program shall be to help
                  prevent accidents and injuries resulting from the
                  misuse of alcohol and controlled substances by drivers
                  performing safety-sensitive functions.</p>
                  <p>The following administrative procedure represents a
                  summary of the main provisions found in federal
                  regulations promulgated to effectuate drug and alcohol
                  testing of bus drivers. The following procedure in no
                  way attempts to modify said regulations, which should
                  always be referred to when questions as to
                  implementation of this policy/procedure arise.</p>
                  <ol type="I">
                  <li><p><strong>APPLICABILITY</strong> All persons
                  operating a commercial motor vehicle in commerce in
                  any state and subject to the commercial driver’s
                  license requirements mandated under both federal and
                  state laws, including the Omnibus Transportation
                  Employee Testing Act of 1991, shall be subject to the
                  drug and alcohol testing provisions herein
                  contained.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>IMPLEMENTATION</strong> The Executive
                  Director shall be responsible for implementing a drug
                  and alcohol-testing program which complies with
                  procedures set forth in Title 49 Parts 40, 382, 390
                  and 395 of the Federal Code of Regulations. Such
                  testing program shall include pre-employment/pre-duty
                  drug testing, post-accident testing, random testing,
                  reasonable suspicion testing, return-to-duty and
                  follow-up testing. MSSM shall provide parties subject
                  to testing with written notice of materials and
                  information available to them as required by Part
                  382.</p>
                  <p>Bid specifications and contracts for transportation
                  shall require that the contractor establish a drug and
                  alcohol-testing program which complies with federal
                  regulations and that is acceptable to the
                  Board.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES</strong>
                  Controlled substances in this policy/procedure refer

                  (PCP).</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>SAFETY-SENSITIVE FUNCTION</strong>
                  Safety-sensitive function(s) in this policy/procedure
                  refer to functions defined in 49 CFR §382.107 and
                  §395.2 (On-Duty Time, paragraphs (1) through
                  (6)).</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>PROHIBITIONS</strong> All drivers
                  subject to this policy shall be prohibited from:</p>

                  <li><p>Using any alcohol for eight (8) hours following
                  an accident, or until he/she undergoes a post-accident
                  alcohol test, whichever occurs first;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Refusing to submit to a required alcohol or

                  using any controlled substance, except when use is
                  pursuant to the instructions of a physician who
                  advised the driver that the substance does not
                  adversely affect the driver’s ability to safely
                  operate the vehicle; and</p></li>
                  <li><p>Reporting for duty, remaining on duty, or

                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p><strong>REQUIRED TESTING</strong></p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p>Pre-Employment Testing Prior to the first time
                  a driver performs a safety-sensitive function MSSM,
                  the driver shall undergo testing for controlled
                  substances. However, no driver shall be subjected to
                  pre-employment controlled substance testing prior to
                  having been offered a position. Employment is
                  conditioned upon a verified negative controlled
                  substance test result.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Post-Accident Testing As soon as practicable
                  following an accident, each surviving driver will be

                  or</p></li>
                  <li><p>Should one or more motor vehicles incurring
                  disabling damage as a result of the accident, require

                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>In addition, the following provisions will also

                  <ol type="a">
                  <li><p>Alcohol</p>
                  <p>If a test required under this section is not
                  administered within two (2) hours following the
                  accident, MSSM shall prepare and maintain on file a
                  record stating the reasons the test was not promptly
                  administered. If a test is not administered within
                  eight (8) hours following the accident, MSSM shall
                  cease attempts to administer the test and shall
                  prepare and maintain the same record. Records shall be
                  submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
                  upon request of the Associate Administrator.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Controlled Substances</p>

                  the accident, MSSM shall cease attempts to administer
                  the test and shall prepare and maintain on file a
                  record stating the reasons the test was not promptly
                  administered. Records shall be submitted to the FHWA
                  upon request of the Associate Administrator.</p></li>

                  <li><p>Random Testing</p>
                  <p>All drivers subject to this policy/procedure will
                  be subject to random and unannounced alcohol and
                  controlled substance testing throughout the year. The
                  minimum annual percentage rate for testing of bus
                  drivers is as follows:</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>Random alcohol testing shall be a minimum of 10
                  percent of the number of driver positions each
                  selection period; and</p></li>
                  <li><p>Random controlled substance testing shall be a
                  minimum of 50 percent of the number of driver
                  positions each selection period.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>Reasonable Suspicion Testing</p>
                  <p>All drivers subject to this policy/procedure shall
                  submit to alcohol and controlled substance testing
                  when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe
                  that the driver has violated the prohibitions found in
                  Part V of this procedure, with the exception of Part
                  V.B. regarding alcohol possession. MSSM shall base its
                  determination that reasonable suspicion exists
                  requiring the driver to undergo such testing on
                  observations concerning appearance, behavior, speech
                  or body odors of the driver. When controlled
                  substances are at issue, observations may include
                  indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of
                  controlled substances.</p>
                  <p>In addition, the following provisions also
                  apply:</p>
                  <ol type="1">
                  <li><p>Alcohol</p>
                  <p>Alcohol testing will be performed only if the
                  aforementioned observations are made during, just
                  preceding, or just after the period of the workday
                  that the driver is required to be in compliance with
                  this policy/procedure. If a test required under this
                  section is not administered within two (2) hours
                  following the reasonable suspicion determination, MSSM
                  shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating
                  the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If
                  a test required under this section is not administered
                  within eight (8) hours following a determination that
                  reasonable suspicion exists, MSSM shall cease attempts
                  to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the
                  record reasons for not administering the test. MSSM
                  shall submit to the FHWA records of tests required by
                  this section that were not completed within eight (8)
                  hours according to the mandates of 49 CFR §382.307

                  <p>MSSM shall, within twenty-four (24) hours or before
                  the results of the controlled substances test are
                  released, whichever is earlier, create a written
                  record of the observations leading to a controlled
                  substances test which shall be signed by the
                  administrator or MSSM official making said
                  observations.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p>Return-to-Duty Testing</p>
                  <p>Prior to returning to duty requiring the
                  performance of safety sensitive functions when a
                  driver has engaged in conduct prohibited under this
                  policy/procedure, the driver shall undergo a
                  return-to-duty alcohol and/or controlled substances
                  test(s) as appropriate.</p>
                  <p>Drivers found to have engaged in prohibited conduct
                  under the alcohol provisions of this policy/procedure
                  will not be permitted to return to duty unless the
                  subsequent alcohol test reveals a result less than or
                  consistent with federal and state standards. In cases
                  involving controlled substances, a verified negative
                  result is necessary before a driver may return to
                  duty.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Follow-up Testing</p>
                  <p>In the event that a driver has been found to have
                  been in violation of the prohibitions herein contained
                  and is identified as requiring assistance in resolving
                  problems associated with alcohol and/or controlled
                  substances, MSSM shall require the driver to submit to
                  at least six (6) unannounced follow-up alcohol and/or
                  controlled substances tests during the first twelve
                  (12) months after returning to duty. Follow-up tests
                  will be unannounced and may continue for up to sixty
                  (60) months after returning to duty. Follow-up alcohol
                  testing shall be conducted only when the driver is
                  performing, just before, or just after ceasing to
                  perform safety-sensitive functions.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p><strong>REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO
                  TESTING</strong></p>
                  <p>All drivers who are required by federal regulations
                  to submit to drug/alcohol testing must do so
                  immediately upon being directed to submit to the
                  test(s). A driver’s refusal to submit to testing will
                  subject the driver to immediate removal from the
                  performance of safety-sensitive functions. In
                  addition, failure to comply with Federal regulations
                  or this procedure is grounds for disciplinary action
                  up to and including dismissal. Any of the following
                  actions on the part of a driver constitutes a refusal
                  to submit to a test:</p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p>Failure to provide adequate specimens/samples
                  of substance(s) undergoing testing, including but not
                  limited to breath and urine, without a valid medical
                  reason;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Refusing to empty his or her pockets;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Refusing to wash his/her hands after being
                  directed to do so by the test collector;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Admitting to the collector that he/she
                  adulterated or substituted his/her specimen;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Behaving in a confrontational way that disrupts
                  the collection process;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Declines to allow a collection to be monitored
                  or directly observed (as allowed federal
                  regulations);</p></li>
                  <li><p>With respect to direct observation collections,
                  the employee fails to follow the observer’s
                  instructions to raise or lower their clothing and to
                  turn around to permit the observer to determine if the
                  employee has a prosthetic or other device that could
                  be used to interfere with the collection process; or
                  the employee possesses or wears a prosthetic or other
                  device that could be used to interfere with the
                  collection process;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Refuses to void through self-catheterization if
                  this is the employee’s normal method.</p></li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Refusal to cooperate in completion of required
                  paperwork is recorded by the collector, but does not
                  by itself constitute a refusal to test.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>TRAINING FOR SUPERVISORS</strong></p>
                  <p>MSSM will assign persons who will be designated to
                  determine whether reasonable suspicion exists to
                  require a driver to undergo testing under Part 382,
                  with at least sixty (60) minutes of training on
                  alcohol misuse and receive at least an additional
                  sixty (60) minutes of training on controlled
                  substances. Training shall cover the physical,
                  behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of
                  probable alcohol misuse and use of controlled
                  substances.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>ENFORCEMENT</strong></p>
                  <p>MSSM, in its independent authority as an employer,
                  shall subject any driver who violates this
                  policy/administrative procedure or Federal regulations
                  to potential disciplinary action up to and including
                  dismissal, except to the extent that any state law
                  requires otherwise. In addition, any driver who
                  refuses to submit to a post-accident, random,
                  reasonable suspicion, return-to duty or follow-up
                  test(s) shall not perform or continue to perform
                  safety-sensitive functions.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, no driver tested and found to have an
                  alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than
                  0.04 shall perform or continue to perform
                  safety-sensitive functions including driving a
                  commercial motor vehicle until the start of the
                  driver’s next regularly scheduled duty period, but not
                  less than twenty-four (24) hours after the test was
                  administered.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>RECORDS</strong></p>
                  <p>Employee drug and alcohol tests and results shall
                  be maintained under strict confidentiality in a secure
                  location with controlled access and released only in
                  accordance with law. A driver, upon written request,
                  shall receive copies of any records pertaining to
                  his/her use of drugs or alcohol, including any records
                  pertaining to his/her drug tests. Records shall be
                  made available to subsequent employers or other
                  identified persons only when expressly requested in
                  writing by the driver.</p></li>
                  <li><p><strong>NOTIFICATIONS</strong></p>
                  <p>Each driver shall receive educational materials
                  prior to MSSM’s commencement of alcohol and controlled
                  substances testing. Such material will explain the
                  requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title
                  49 Part 382, and contain a copy of the Board’s policy
                  and administrative procedures for meeting these
                  requirements. MSSM shall also include in the package
                  of informational material submitted to each driver a
                  statement certifying that he/she has received the
                  informational material. MSSM shall maintain the
                  original signed copy of the statement on file.</p>
                  <p>In addition to the aforementioned items, MSSM shall
                  also make available to drivers and representatives of
                  employee organizations information which shall
                  identify:</p>

                  <li><p>The procedures that will be used to test for
                  the presence of alcohol and controlled substances;
                  protect the driver and the integrity of the testing
                  processes, safeguard the validity of the test results,
                  and ensure that those results are attributed to the
                  correct driver;</p></li>
                  <li><p>Information concerning the effects of alcohol
                  and controlled substances on an individual’s health,
                  work, and personal life; signs and symptoms of an
                  alcohol or a controlled substance(s) problem (the
                  driver’s or co-worker’s); and available methods of
                  intervening when an alcohol or controlled substances
                  problem is suspected, including confrontation,
                  referral to any employee assistance program and/or
                  referral to management; and</p></li>
                  <li><p>Post-accident procedures that will make it
                  possible for a driver to comply with post-accident
                  testing before any driver operates a commercial
                  vehicle. MSSM shall also make available the following
                  information:</p>
                  <ol type="A">
                  <li><p>The results of pre-employment controlled

                  notified of the disposition of the employment
                  application; and</p></li>
                  <li><p>The results of random, reasonable suspicion and
                  post-accident drug tests if the results are verified

                  controlled substance(s) was verified as
                  positive.</p></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  </ol></li>
                  <li><p><strong>CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES</strong></p>
                  <p>Drivers shall inform their supervisors if at any
                  time they are using a controlled substance which their
                  physician has prescribed for therapeutic purposes.
                  Such substance may be used in conjunction with duty
                  only if the physician has advised the driver that it
                  will not adversely affect his/her ability to safely
                  operate a commercial motor vehicle.</p></li>

                  <p>A driver who engages in such prohibited conduct
                  shall be evaluated by a substance abuse professional
                  who shall determine what assistance or treatment, if
                  any, the employee needs in resolving controlled
