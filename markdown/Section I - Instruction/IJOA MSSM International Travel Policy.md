title: MSSM INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL APPROVAL PROTOCOL
---

# General

The following protocol is written to clarify the approval process for
faculty and staff considering taking MSSM students on international
trips.

# Background

Global education and programming have been hot topics in high-school
education for the last 10 years. However, the risks associated with
these programs have raised concerns from school leaders considering such
programs. There also appears to be a lack of much concrete guidance in
terms of best practices for managing risk in this evolving field. These
issues reached an important head in 2013 when one independent school
received a multimillion dollar verdict against it as a result of a
lawsuit brought by a student for an injury sustained on a school trip:

> CT Supreme Court Weighs in on Hotchkiss Case: Travel and exposure to
> the world outside the classroom walls is an important part of an
> independent school education, but it is not without risk. This stark
> reality was confirmed last week when the Connecticut Supreme Court
> upheld a \$41.7 million verdict against the Hotchkiss School for
> failing to warn students about the potential for tick bites prior to a
> trip to China, during which a student became gravelly ill, allegedly
> as a result of such a bite. '
