title: MSSM INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL PROTOCOL
---

In a 21^st^ century world, an increasing part of student education
occurs away from Campus, including extended overseas travel. Providing
these enhancing international experiences, however, often exposes
schools to some liability. It is therefore both legally necessary and
pragmatically expedient to articulate clear MSSM guidelines for such
activities in order to minimize risk to students and chaperones through
detailed planning and approval of such activities.

All international trips associated with MSSM must be presented to the
Administrative Advisory Team twelve months in advance of the planned
date of departure for approval to proceed. The written proposal should
include the following:

# Purpose

MSSM international travel should have a distinct curriculum related
educational purpose rather than be a 'holiday.

# Participation

International trips are a privilege, not a right, and MSSM reserves the
ability to deny a Student the right to participate based upon historical
behavior patterns that would lead to the conclusion that they might
cause a problem while traveling overseas.

# Research

Those faculty and staff planning such trips should thoroughly research
intended destinations with a specific focus on safety considerations.
This should include a check with the U.S. State Department to determine
whether there as ben a travel advisory posted for the intended
destination(s). This is particularly important when contemplating travel
to less developed areas with weak tort law, chaotic traffic, and poor
highway systems. The U.S. State Department reports that a third of the
total risk to students happens during highway travel, and another 10
percent happens on boats, planes, and trains. More than a quarter of the
total risk to students is drowning during swimming activities, and the
remaining 30 percent of risk is a mixture of fires, falls, sickness, and
pedestrian travel. All of these factors should be weighed closely as
part of a risk analysis during trip research and planning.

# Discipline

During all intentional travel, the expectations and rules contained
within the MSSM Community Handbook remain in force for all participants,
in all places, and at all times.

# Faculty / Student Ratio

All international trips require a minimum of two qualified school adult
chaperones with a ratio of one adult to six students. Both adults are
required to be first aid trained including, dispensing medication,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and use of automated external
defibrillators.

# Parent Release

The organizer is required to obtain a signed release from liability from
parents of students participating in the trip. The release from
liability form should include the following information sufficient that
parents knowingly understand the full scope of what their child will be
undertaking:

-   Name of parents and student:
-   Trip Details: Educational objective of trip: why is this trip being
    taken?
-   Itinerary: what are the exact details?
-   Student activities: what will the students be doing, particularly if
    they will be required to participate in physically demanding or
    somewhat dangerous events, e.g.Â Whitewater rafting.
-   Equipment and supplies: anything the students should bring with
    them.
-   Transportation plan: all of the details. When, where, and how.
-   Costs and expenses anticipated: mandatory costs and a notation of
    any discretionary money that may be needed by the student. (e.g.: if
    time will be provided for students to shop at a gift store, etc.)
-   Medical authorization: This information should include a physician's
    name and number, as well as an emergency number for either or both
    parents, and a release for the overseeing adult on the trip to make
    at least initial medical decisions on behalf of the parents until
    the parents or other emergency contact can be reached.
-   Agreement by both the parent and the child that the school policies
    and any additional rules will be followed.
-   Insurance coverage: Comprehensive travel insurance must be in place
    that includes all medical contingencies including treatment,
    hospitalization, and repatriation.
-   Hold harmless clause \[parent's name\] agrees to release and hold
    harmless \[school name, administrators, and chaperones\] from any
    and all liability, loss, damages, claims, or actions for bodily
    injury and/or property damage arising out of participation in this
    trip, in accordance with current state and federal law.

#Emergency Preparedness

In light of the 9/11 tragedies and recent natural disasters, trip
organizers must have contingency plans in place in the event that an
emergency arises. These must include:

-   Chaperones must have enough credit or access to funds to afford the
    group another several nights in a hotel in case the borders of
    either the country being visited or the United States close.
-   Each student should have extra money or a credit card for emergency
    use.
-   At least one school adult on the trip should have a cell phone with
    adequate service coverage, including international coverage.
-   Every person on the trip should have the cell phone number and an
    emergency callin number so that everyone can be accounted for, even
    if the group gets separated.
-   Chaperones will contact an MSSM administrator designated by the
    Executive Director every third day of the trip to confirm that all
    is well.
