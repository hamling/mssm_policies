title: PROGRESS REPORTS
---

The Executive Director will be responsible for ensuring the development
of a system for communicating information regarding student achievement
and academic progress to students and parents which shall include an
online component for parent access. Within this system, grades,
narratives, and other forms of reporting should be understandable to
parents and should indicate how the student is progressing relative to
the assessment system as well as performance in specific courses or
content areas.

As a component of the system, a grade report will be issued for each
student at regular intervals set by the Dean of Faculty in the School's
annual calendar. These grade reports will be made available to the
student and his/her parent(s)/guardian(s).

The Dean of Faculty will provide written notification to students and
parents by the end of each semester if the student may not advance to
the next grade or may be considered for dismissal from MSSM or if the
student may not qualify for an MSSM diploma because he/she has not met
the required standards.
