code: IHBAC
title: CHILD FIND
---

The Maine School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM) is a public magnet
school and agency of the State of Maine and does not meet the definition
of a School Administrative Unit (SAU) as defined by Title 20-A ยง26 nor
does it have the responsibility for identification of special needs
students in any jurisdiction as described for School Administrative
Units (SAUs) in Section IV.2 of the Maine Unified Special Education
Regulations.

MSSM affirms its role in supporting services for students with special
needs that otherwise meet its admission requirements. A student's need
for special services does not preclude the admission of a student who
otherwise meets the School's admission standards.

MSSM's Child Find process shall include obtaining data on each enrolled
student through direct assessment or by indirect means. This assessment
can include evaluation of students' academic performance, gross and fine
motor skills, receptive and expressive language skills, vision, hearing,
and cognitive skills.

If the Child Find process indicates that a student may require special
education and supportive services in order to benefit from instruction,
the student shall be referred to the IEP team to determine the student's
eligibility for special education services. School staff, parents, or
agency representatives may refer students to the IEP team if they
believe that the student, because of a disability, may be in need of
special education and supportive services in order to benefit from
instruction. Some factors that may be considered when making a referral
might include the following:

a.  if a student has accumulated the equivalent of 10 full days of
    unexcused absences or seven consecutive school days of unexcused
    absences during a school year;
b.  has been suspended or removed for disciplinary reasons in excess of
    10 cumulative school days in the school year; or
c.  has experienced an illness, hospitalization, or accident that may
    indicate a need for special education and supportive services.

These considerations are guidelines only and do not mandate or preclude
referral to the IEP team.
