title: STUDENT SUBMISSION TO SURVEYS, ANALYSES OR EVALUATIONS
---

In this policy, "surveys, analyses or evaluations" refer to methods of
gathering data for research purposes. No student shall be required as
part of any program to submit to any survey, analysis, or evaluation
that reveals information concerning:

A.  Political affiliations or beliefs of the student or the student's
    parent

B.  Mental or psychological problems of the student or the student's
    family

C.  Sex behavior or attitudes

D.  Illegal, anti-social, self-incriminating, or demeaning behavior

E.  Critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have
    close family relationships

F.  Legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as
    those of lawyers, physicians, and ministers

G.  Religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student or
    student's parents; or

H.  Income (other than that required by law to determine eligibility for
    participation in a program or for receiving financial assistance
    under such program without the prior written consent of the
    student's parent/guardian, or of the student, if he/she is 18 years
    of age or older.

All instructional materials, including teachers' manuals, films, tapes,
or other supplementary material which will be used in connection with
any such survey, analysis, or evaluation shall be available upon request
for inspection by the student's parent/guardian. For the purpose of this
policy, "instructional material" does not include academic tests or
assessments.

A parent may inspect, upon request, a survey created by a third party
before the survey is administered or distributed to a student.

The Executive Director/designee will be responsible for implementing any
procedures necessary to protect the privacy of participating students
and to provide parents with access to surveys within a reasonable time
before administration or distribution.

The school unit will notify parents of this policy at least annually at
the beginning of the school year and within a reasonable time of any
substantive change in policy. Insofar as practicable,\* the school unit
will also directly notify parents annually at the beginning of the
school year when surveys, analyses, or evaluations are scheduled or
anticipated. Parents shall have the opportunity to opt their child out
of participation in any survey, analysis, or evaluation. Students who
are 18 years of age or older may opt out of such surveys, analyses, or
evaluations.

\* "Insofar as practicable" acknowledges that there may be circumstances
in which a research request is made or is approved only after the school
year has begun. When this occurs, the school should notify parents far
enough in advance for them to access surveys and related instructional
materials and to opt their children out, if desired.
