code: IHBAA
title: REFERRAL/PRE-REFERRAL OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES
---

MSSM professional staff are obligated to refer all enrolled students
suspected of having a disability that may require special education to
Special Education staff for an evaluation in all suspected areas of
disability. Where MSSM is a residential school, it devolves to
professional staff to be especially vigilant in the assessment of
students' potential disabilities. Referrals of students to Special
Education staff may be made by parents/guardians at any time, as well as
by professional School staff and other persons knowledgeable about the
child's educational needs. Any such referral shall be made in accordance
with established procedures.

Regardless of the source of the referral, a referral will be considered
received on the date that the written referral is received by MSSM
Special Education staff. It shall be signed and dated by the Special
Education Consultant or Executive Director, thereby indicating the date
of the receipt of that referral.

The Executive Director, in consultation with Special Education staff,
will develop procedures for referral and the use of pre-referral
interventions within MSSM, and may, from time to time, amend those
procedures as necessary.
