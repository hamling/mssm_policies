title: EXPENSE AUTHORIZATION AND REIMBURSEMENT
---

MSSM recognizes that some School business expenses involve initial
payment by a School employee or a Board member and that such expense may
qualify for reimbursement. The purpose of this policy is to promote
financial accountability by requiring prior authorization of
expenditures and the establishment of procedures for the reimbursement
of expenses.

A.  **Authorization** All employee expenses to be reimbursed must be
    pre-approved by the employee's supervising administrator, allowable
    up to \$50. Any amount over \$50 must receive preapproval
    authorization from the Executive Director. All Board member expenses
    to be reimbursed shall be approved by the Board Chair prior to the
    member incurring the expense. Expenses to be reimbursed may include
    transportation, lodging, registration fees, required materials,
    parking fees, and other reasonable and necessary business-related
    expenses.

B.  **Reimbursement** All requests for reimbursement shall be itemized
    on an official MSSM travel voucher. Receipts for reimbursable
    expenses must be attached to the reimbursement form. Automobile
    travel in a personal vehicle shall be reimbursed at the state
    mileage rate as of October 1^st^ of each year. Reimbursement for
    commercial transportation shall be based on coach/economy fares.
    Receipts are necessary for all reimbursements. Automobile travel
    should take place in a School vehicle whenever possible. When
    circumstances dictate that a rental car is necessary and/or the most
    practical approach to travel, the least expensive car that shall
    meet the purpose should be rented.

C.  **Unapproved Expenses** School employees and Board members who incur
    expenses that have not been approved in advance as required by this
    policy shall be personally accountable for such expenses. State law
    prohibits payment for alcoholic beverages.

D.  **Reimbursement Procedures** The Chief Operating Officer/designee
    shall be responsible for developing a schedule of reimbursement
    rates for business expenses, including those expenses requiring
    advance approval and specific rates of reimbursement. The Chief
    Operating Officer/designee shall also develop procedures to address
    methods and timing for submission of requests for reimbursement.

E.  **Advances** Advances come in the following two types: Prepaid
    expenses and cash advances.

    1.  Prepaid expenses: In the event that the School pre-pays any
        expenses for travel (e.g.Â rooms, fees, etc.), the employee
        traveling shall include expended amounts on the travel voucher
        and list the amount paid by the School on the "advance line."
        Receipts for these expenses must be included with the travel
        voucher.

    2.  Cash Advances: In the event that travel on School business
        places a financial burden on an employee, the employee may
        submit a request for a cash advance one week before the travel.
        The amount of the advance shall not exceed the amount the
        employee will be expected to pay during his/her travel.
