title: REVENUES FROM INVESTMENTS
---

The School considers an investment program a critical ingredient of
sound fiscal management. The Board of Trustees authorizes an investment
program for the purpose of securing a maximum yield of interest revenues
to supplement other revenues for the support of the School's educational
program.

The investment program will be administered in a way that will ensure:

A.  The continuous process of temporary investing of all fund balances
    and moneys available for investment purposes;

B.  The maintenance (revised following each cash transaction) of a
    yearly cash flow chart that will provide data to assist proper
    planning and decision making regarding amount, duration and type of
    investments;

C.  The use of an open competition system of bids and/or quotes to
    obtain the maximum yield possible on all investments from both local
    community and beyond-community financial institutions;

D.  That all vendors using School funds provide statements to the School
    of their collateral in the form of a list of the securities pledged
    at market value; and

E.  That all School investments will be in compliance with the law.

## Delegation of Authority

The School authorizes the School's Chief Operating Officer and
Superintendent to manage all activities associated with the investment
program in such manner as to accomplish the objectives of this policy.
Their responsibilities will also include annual review and assessment of
the School's investment program and filing a report and recommendations
annually with the Board. The School's Chief Operating Officer or his/her
designee is further authorized to execute in the Board's name any and
all documents relating to the investment program in a timely manner and
to confer with reputable consultants regarding investment decisions when
necessary.

A quarterly progress report of investments will be made to the Board.
