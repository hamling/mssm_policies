title: PETTY CASH ACCOUNTS
---

In order to facilitate refunds and minor purchases, the Board of
Trustees authorizes a petty cash fund in the Residential Facility and in
the Administrative offices.

The custodian for the accounts at the Residential Facility will be the
Director of Residential Life. The account custodian at the
Administrative office will be the Superintendent/designee. Each
transaction must be supported with proper receipts by the account
custodian.

Justifiable expenditures from the petty cash accounts will include but
not be limited to: miscellaneous materials and supplies (\$50 maximum)
for office supplies, stamps and freight. All items purchased with petty
cash funds should meet the criteria of an expedient measure and should
not be used to circumvent established policy on purchasing authority.

The petty cash funds will be replenished as imprest funds and reimbursed
to each account through accounts payable after approval by the Chief
Operating Officer/designee.
