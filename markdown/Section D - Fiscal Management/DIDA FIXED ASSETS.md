title: FIXED ASSETS
---

This policy establishes the minimum cost value (capitalization amount)
that shall be used to determine the capital assets, including
infrastructure assets, that are to be recorded in Maine School of
Science and Mathematics' (MSSM) annual financial statements in order to
comply with the requirements of GASB Statement No. 34.

The policy also addresses other considerations for recording and
depreciating fixed assets in order to comply with the provisions of GASB
Statement No. 34.

A.  **Capital Asset Definition** Capital assets will be defined as
    tangible and intangible assets that have initial useful lives that
    extend beyond a single reporting period.

B.  **Capitalization Method** All capital assets will be recorded at
    historical costs as of the date acquired or constructed. If
    historical cost information is not available, assets will be
    recorded at estimated historical cost by calculating current
    replacement cost and deflating the cost using the appropriate
    price-level index.

C.  **Capitalization Thresholds** MSSM establishes the following minimum
    capitalization thresholds for capitalizing fixed assets:

    1.  Land and Improvements \$ 5,000
    2.  Buildings and Improvements 5,000
    3.  Machinery/Equipment/Vehicles 5,000
    4.  Infrastructure 5,000

    Detailed records shall be maintained for all fixed assets above the
    established thresholds.

D.  **Infrastructure Assets** In accordance with GASB Statement 34 MSSM
    will record, at a minimum, "major" infrastructure asset as defined
    in Statement 34 that were acquired, constructed, or significantly
    reconstructed, or that received significant improvements after June
    30, 1980. Other infrastructure asset may be capitalized as deemed
    appropriate. MSSM does not intend to use the "modified approach" to
    record infrastructure.

E.  **Other Assets** Detailed records shall be maintained at the
    discretion of the Superintendent for all items below the
    capitalization thresholds that should be safeguarded from loss.
    These items will be part of the annual physical inventory discussed
    below. These items include computer equipment that falls below the
    established thresholds and any other assets specified by the
    Superintendent.

F.  **Depreciation and Useful Life** The School business executive will
    assign an estimated useful life to all assets for the purposes of
    recording depreciation. The Association of School Business
    Officials' "Useful Lives" schedule will be used to establish lives
    for most assets. Asset lives will be adjusted as necessary depending
    on the present condition and use of the asset and based on how long
    the asset is expected to meet current service demands. Adjustments
    should be properly documented. Depreciation will be recorded based
    on the straight line method using actual month convention and
    depreciated down to the assets salvage value.

G.  **Safeguarding and Controlling Fixed Assets** All machinery and
    equipment, vehicles, and furniture will be assigned an asset number
    and identified with a fixed asset tag. As fixed assets are purchased
    or disposed of, the administrator in custody of that asset will be
    responsible for preparing a fixed asset data sheet, which will then
    be forwarded to the School business executive to ensure proper
    recording. A physical inventory will be taken annually on or about
    June 30 and compared to the physical inventory records. The results
    will be forwarded to the School business executive where appropriate
    adjustments will be made to the fixed asset records.
