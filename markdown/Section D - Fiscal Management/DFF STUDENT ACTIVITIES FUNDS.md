title: STUDENT ACTIVITIES FUNDS
---

Revenues collected from admissions to School entertainment events,
profits from School stores, club and class dues, and student
organization fundraising activities shall be deposited and accounted for
in a student activities fund maintained by the School. Within this fund,
separate accounts will be maintained for each organization for
accounting purposes. These revenues will be considered School funds
under the direct control of the Chief Operating Officer, who may develop
and implement procedures relative to these funds and delegate specific
responsibility for deposits, expenditures, and record keeping to the
appropriate staff. Procedures for management of student activities funds
shall be consistent with sound business and accounting practices.

Funds raised by approved student clubs or organizations or from classes
shall be expended to benefit the specific club or organization or class.
Student activity funds are to be used only for student activities that
augment the School's programs; they shall not replace funding for School
programs and activities. All expenditures from student activities funds
must be approved in advance by the activity advisor or the Chief
Operating Officer.

Student activity funds for clubs which have become defunct will be
transferred to the Student Activity Seed fund in the School year
following the club's demise. These funds may be appropriated by the
Executive Director for seed funds for new clubs or activities or other
purposes consistent with this policy.

Student activity funds are part of the total fiscal operation of the
School and shall be audited as part of the annual audit.
