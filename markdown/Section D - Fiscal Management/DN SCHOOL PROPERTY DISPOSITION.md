title: SCHOOL PROPERTY DISPOSITION (PROPERTY OTHER THAN REAL ESTATE)
---

The Executive Director is authorized to determine, through procedures
he/she develops, whether personal property such as supplies, books,
materials, and equipment is obsolete or no longer of use to the School
and to declare it surplus personal property. Procedures for disposal of
surplus property shall be in accordance with the following:

A.  The Board is to be informed of any property valued over \$5,000.00
    which is declared surplus by the Executive Director prior to its
    disposal.

B.  Surplus property which is offered for sale shall be disposed of by
    sealed bids or proposals, public auction, public sale, or by other
    such means as the Board may direct. Notice of any sale of surplus
    property shall be given in a manner reasonably calculated to notify
    potentially interested parties of such sale.

C.  Any surplus property which is offered for sale and is not sold may
    be disposed of in a manner deemed advisable by the Executive
    Director, including donation to nonprofit agencies.

D.  The Executive Director may sell or donate surplus property to a
    specific community service organization or governmental agency
    (state, county, local, or quasi-governmental) if, in the Executive
    Director's judgment, the sale or donation will best serve the
    interests of the School and the community, and when such sale or
    donation is not contrary to law.

E.  Any property deemed to be worthless, or for any reason considered to
    be inappropriate for sale, may be disposed of in a manner the
    Executive Director deems appropriate.

F.  All revenues which result from the sale of surplus property shall be
    credited in one of the following ways: 1) as miscellaneous School
    income; or 2) when required by law, to a specific account.
