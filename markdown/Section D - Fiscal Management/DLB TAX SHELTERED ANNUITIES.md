title: TAX SHELTERED ANNUITIES
---

So that employees may obtain the benefit of tax sheltered annuities, the
Board of Trustees hereby authorizes the adoption of a Tax Sheltered
Annuity Plan. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) is authorized to sign a
written Tax Sheltered Annuity Plan (the "Plan") on behalf of the Board.
The Plan shall provide that:

A.  Any employee may participate in the Tax Sheltered Annuity Plan,
    subject to the limitations of the Plan and the Internal Revenue
    Code.

B.  Any agent or agency wishing to sell tax sheltered annuities to
    employees must file with the COO evidence of its license to sell
    such annuities in the State of Maine.

C.  Only those providers of annuities who agree to comply with the terms
    of the Plan shall be permitted to participate as an annuity provider
    under the Tax Sheltered Annuity Plan. In accordance with the Plan,
    the Board retains the right to limit the number of annuity providers
    authorized to sell annuities to employees.

D.  At no time will solicitation by providers of tax sheltered annuities
    be permitted in School buildings or on School property during
    regular School hours.
