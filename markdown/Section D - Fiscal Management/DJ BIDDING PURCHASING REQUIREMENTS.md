code: DJ
title: BIDDING PURCHASING REQUIREMENTS
---

The School Board of Trustees expects all purchases made by the School to
be consistent with applicable laws and sound business practices. The
Superintendent shall be responsible for developing and implementing
administrative procedures for bidding and purchasing consistent with
this policy.

This policy is intended solely as an internal guide to purchasing by the
School. It does not afford any vendor any property or contractual rights
against the School. No vendor shall have any enforceable rights against
the School based upon this policy or alleged violations of this policy.
No vendor shall have any rights against the School until such time as a
written contract between the vendor and the School is executed by the
vendor and an authorized representative of the School.

A.  **Bidding Required by Law** Maine law requires the Board to
    competitively bid property and casualty insurance; School bus and
    transportation contracts in excess of \$4,000; School building
    construction, alterations and repairs over \$25,000 (except
    contracts for professional architectural and engineering services);
    and bond anticipation notes for state-subsidized School construction
    projects.

B.  **Competitive Bidding of Other Purchases** Where bidding is not
    required by law, it shall be the policy of the School to
    competitively bid purchases of equipment, supplies, materials or
    services over \$10,000 provided that it is practical and
    cost-effective to specify the materials or services with sufficient
    particularity to allow meaningful comparison of bids.

    If competitive bidding is not utilized, the Superintendent may seek
    Requests for Proposals (RFP) for purchases over \$10,000. An RFP
    identifies the need the School intends to meet, but permits the
    vendor to propose the manner in which the work is to be performed
    and the materials to be used.

    The Superintendent may forego the competitive bid or RFP process
    only when he/she determines that quality, expertise, time factors,
    or other important considerations outweigh the possible benefits of
    bidding or requesting proposals.

C.  **Procedures for Bidding and Requesting Proposals** The method of
    notification that the School uses to solicit bids and proposals
    shall be reasonably designed to attract qualified vendors. Depending
    upon the circumstances, such notification may include public
    advertising and/or mailing of notices to potential vendors.

D.  **Bid Procedures**

    1.  The notification shall specify the deadline for submitting bids
        and the time and place of bid opening. Bid alternates shall be
        permitted at the discretion of the Superintendent. The notice
        shall reserve the right of the School to reject any or all bids,
        and to waive technical or immaterial non-conformities in bids if
        in the best interest of the School, and to exercise judgment in
        evaluating bids.

    2.  **Written bids** Bids shall be in writing, sealed with outside
        envelope or wrapper plainly marked "Bid, not to be opened until
        (insert appropriate date)," and mailed or filed with the
        Superintendent.

    3.  **Time of opening** A School Board member or employee of the
        School may not open a bid until the appointed time.

    4.  **Public opening**At the time and place stated in the public
        notice, and open to the public, all bids shall be opened by the
        Superintendent or, in the Superintendent's absence or
        disability, by any Board member designated for the purpose by
        the Chair of the Board.

    5.  **Reading** If any citizens who are not Board members or
        employees of the School or if any representatives of the press
        are present, bids shall, at that time, either be made available
        for examination by them or shall be read aloud in a manner to be
        heard plainly by those in attendance.

    6.  In general, the Board will award contracts to the lowest bidder
        which the Superintendent and the Board deem can satisfactorily
        fulfill the contract.

E.  **RFP Procedures**

    1.  Proposals should be submitted in plain envelopes clearly marked
        "Proposal, not to be opened until (state time and date)." The
        RFP shall state the time and date that proposals shall be
        opened, and no proposals shall be opened before that time.
        Public opening is not required.

    2.  Proposals are to be evaluated based on criteria appropriate for
        the project in question, and the contract will be awarded to the
        vendor whom the Superintendent deems best able to meet the
        requirements of the School.
