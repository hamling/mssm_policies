code: ACAB-R
title: EMPLOYEE DISCRIMINATION/HARASSMENT AND TITLE IX SEXUAL HARASSMENT
  COMPLAINT PROCEDURES
---

The Board has adopted these employee procedures in order to provide
prompt and equitable resolution of employee complaints of discrimination
and harassment, including sexual harassment, as described in policies
AC - Nondiscrimination/Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action and
ACAB - Harassment and Sexual Harassment of School Employees.

The complaint procedure in Section 2 may also be used, to the extent
applicable, by visitors, including parents, volunteers and others having
lawful access to the schools who wish to make a complaint of
discrimination or harassment.

Complaints alleging harassment or discrimination against students based
on a protected category should be addressed through the Board's Student
Discrimination/Harassment and Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint
Procedures (ACAA-R).

Any individual who is unsure about whether discrimination or harassment
has occurred and/or which complaint procedure applies is encouraged to
contact the Affirmative Action Officer/Title IX Coordinator.

I.  DEFINITIONS

    For purposes of these complaint procedures, the following
    definitions will be used. The Affirmative Action Officer/Title IX
    Coordinator shall assess all reports and complaints to ensure that
    they are addressed under the appropriate policy and complaint
    procedure.

    A.  Discrimination/Harassment Complaint Procedure Definitions

        1.  "Discrimination or harassment": Discrimination or harassment
            on the basis of an individual's membership in a protected
            category, which, for employees, includes race, color, sex,
            sexual orientation, gender identity, age, religion,
            ancestry, national origin, genetic information or
            disability.

        2.  "Discrimination": Treating individuals differently, or
            interfering with or preventing them from enjoying the
            advantages or privileges afforded to others because of their
            membership in a protected category.

        3.  "Harassment": Oral, written, graphic, electronic or physical
            conduct relating to an individual's actual or perceived
            membership in a protected category that is sufficiently
            severe, pervasive or persistent so as to interfere with or
            limit that individual's ability to participate in the
            school's programs or activities by creating a hostile,
            intimidating or offensive environment.

        4.  Under Title VII and under Maine law/regulations, sexual
            harassment is defined differently than under Title IX. Maine
            Human Rights Commission regulations define sexual harassment
            as conduct on the basis of sex which satisfies one or more
            of the following:

            a.  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
                implicitly a term or condition of an individual's
                employment;

            b.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an
                employee is used as the basis for employment decisions
                affecting the employee; or

            c.  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
                interfering with an individual's work performance or
                creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working
                environment.

        5.  "Sexual orientation": Under Maine law, this means a person's
            "actual or perceived heterosexuality, bisexuality,
            homosexuality or gender identity or expression."

        6.  "Gender identity": Under Maine law, this means "the
            gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms or other
            gender-related characteristics of an individual, regardless
            of the individual's assigned sex at birth."

        7.  "Complaint" is defined as an allegation that an employee or
            other third party has been discriminated against or harassed
            on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender
            identity, age, religion, ancestry, national origin, genetic
            information or disability (and in regard to sex, conduct not
            otherwise addressed in the Title IX regulations and Section
            3 of ACAB-R).

        8.  "Employee": Whenever the term "employee" is used in Section
            2, it includes visitors or others who have a lawful basis to
            make a complaint of discrimination or harassment.

    B.  Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedure Definitions

        1.  "Title IX sexual harassment": Under the federal Title IX
            regulations, sexual harassment includes the following
            conduct on the basis of sex which takes place within the
            context of the school's education programs and activities:

            a.  "Quid pro quo" sexual harassment by a school employee:
                Conditioning a school aid, benefit or service (such as a
                promotion or favorable evaluation) on an individual's
                participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;

            b.  "Hostile environment" sexual harassment: Unwelcome
                conduct based on sex that a reasonable person would
                determine is so severe, pervasive and objectively
                offensive that it effectively denies an individual's
                equal access to the school's education programs and
                activities; or

            c.  Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and
                stalking as these terms are defined in federal laws.

        2.  "Report": Under the Title IX regulations, any individual may
            make a report of sexual harassment involving an employee,
            whether the individual is the alleged victim or not. A
            report must be made to the Affirmative Action Officer/Title
            IX Coordinator. A report triggers certain actions by the
            AAO/Title IX Coordinator for the alleged victim of sexual
            harassment, but an investigation is not conducted unless a
            "Formal Complaint" is filed.

        3.  "Formal Complaint": Under Title IX, the alleged victim of
            sexual harassment can file a written complaint that triggers
            the complaint procedure in Section 3 of ACAB-R. Only a
            school employee (and in certain circumstances, the AAO/Title
            IX Coordinator) may file a formal complaint.

        4.  "Employee": For the purpose of this procedure, "employee"
            means an applicant for employment or a current employee of
            the school.

II. DISCRIMINATION/HARASSMENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURE

    This procedure should be used for any complaint of unlawful
    harassment or discrimination based on a protected category which
    does not involve Title IX sexual harassment.

    A.  How to Make A Complaint

        1.  An employee who believes they have been unlawfully harassed
            or discriminated against (as such terms are defined in
            Section 1.A.1-3) is encouraged to try to resolve the problem
            by informing the individual(s) that the behavior is
            unwelcome or offensive, and requesting that the behavior
            stop. This shall not prevent the employee from making an
            immediate complaint to the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.

        2.  Any employee who believes they have been harassed or
            discriminated against should report their concern promptly
            to the AAO/Title IX Coordinator. A written complaint must
            include basic information concerning the allegation of
            harassment or discrimination (i.e., date, time, location,
            individual(s) who allegedly engaged in harassment or
            discrimination, description of allegation).

        3.  Employees who are unsure as to whether unlawful
            discrimination or harassment has occurred, or who need
            assistance in preparing a written complaint, are encouraged
            to discuss the matter with the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.

        4.  Employees will not be retaliated against for reporting
            suspected discrimination or harassment, or for participating
            in an investigation. Retaliation is illegal under federal
            and state nondiscrimination laws, and any retaliation will
            result in disciplinary measures, up to and including
            discharge.

        5.  Any employee who believes they have been discriminated
            against or harassed is encouraged to utilize the school's
            complaint procedure. However, employees are hereby notified
            that they also have the right to report incidents of
            discrimination or harassment to the Maine Human Rights
            Commission, 51 State House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333
            (telephone: 207-624-6290) and/or to the federal Office for
            Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education, 5 Post Office
            Square, 8th Floor, Boston, MA 02109-3921 (telephone:
            617-289-0111).

    B.  Complaint Handling and Investigation

        1.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator will promptly inform the
            Executive Director and the person who is the subject of the
            complaint (respondent) that a complaint has been received.

        2.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator may pursue an informal
            resolution of the complaint with the agreement of the
            parties involved. Any party to the complaint may decide to
            end the informal resolution process and pursue the formal
            process at any point. Any informal resolution is subject to
            the approval of the parties and the Executive Director, who
            shall consider whether the resolution is in the best
            interest of the school and the parties in light of the
            particular circumstances and applicable policies and laws.

        3.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator may implement supportive
            measures (consistent with any applicable collective
            bargaining agreement provisions) to reduce the risk of
            further discrimination or harassment while an investigation
            is pending. Examples of supportive measures include, but are
            not limited to, ordering no contact between the individuals
            involved; changing a work location or changing a work
            schedule.

        4.  The complaint will be investigated by a trained internal or
            external individual designated by the Executive Director and
            the AAO/Title IX Coordinator. Any complaint about an
            employee who holds a supervisory position shall be
            investigated by a person who is not subject to that
            supervisor's authority. Any complaint about the Executive
            Director should be submitted to the Chair of the Board, who
            should consult with legal counsel concerning the handling
            and investigation of the complaint.

        5.  The investigator shall consult with the AAO/Title IX
            Coordinator as agreed during the investigation process.

        6.  The respondent will be provided with an opportunity to be
            heard as part of the investigation. The complainant shall
            not be required to attend meetings with the respondent, but
            may choose to do so as part of an informal resolution
            process.

        7.  The complainant and the respondent may suggest witnesses
            and/or submit materials they believe are relevant to the
            complaint.

        8.  If the complaint is against an employee of the school, any
            rights conferred under an applicable collective bargaining
            agreement shall be applied.

        9.  Privacy rights of all parties to the complaint shall be
            maintained in accordance with applicable state and federal
            laws.

        10. The investigation shall be completed within 40 business days
            of receiving the complaint, if practicable. Reasonable
            extensions of time for good reason shall be allowed.

        11. The investigator shall provide a written report and findings
            to the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.

    C.  Findings and Subsequent Actions

        1.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator shall consult with the
            Executive Director concerning the investigation and
            findings.

        2.  If there is a finding that discrimination or harassment
            occurred, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator, in consultation with
            the Executive Director:

            a.  Shall determine what remedial action, if any, is
                required to end the discrimination or harassment, remedy
                its effect and prevent recurrence; and

            b.  Determine what disciplinary action should be taken
                against the individual(s) who engaged in discrimination
                or harassment, if any.

        3.  Inform the complainant and the respondent in writing of the
            results of the investigation and its resolution (in
            accordance with applicable state and federal privacy laws).

    D.  Appeals

        1.  After the conclusion of the investigation, the complainant
            or respondent may seek an appeal of the findings solely on
            the basis of either: (a) prejudicial procedural error or (b)
            the discovery of previously unavailable relevant evidence
            that could significantly impact the outcome.

        2.  Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Executive
            Director within five business days after receiving notice of
            the resolution.

        3.  Upon receipt of a valid appeal, the Executive Director shall
            provide notice to the other party, along with an opportunity
            to provide a written statement within five business days.

        4.  The Executive Director shall review the available
            documentation and may conduct further investigation if
            deemed appropriate.

        5.  The Executive Director's decision on the appeal shall be
            provided to the parties within 10 business days, if
            practicable. The Executive Director's decision shall be
            final.

    E.  Records

        The AAO/Title IX Coordinator shall keep a written record of the
        complaint process.

III. TITLE IX SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURE

     This section should be used only for complaints of Title IX sexual
     harassment as defined in Section 1.B.1.

     A.  How to Make A Report

         1.  Any individual who believes an employee has been sexually
             harassed (as this term is defined in Section 1.B.1) may
             make a report to the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.

         2.  If the individual making the report is the alleged victim,
             or if the alleged victim is identified by the individual
             making the report, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator will meet
             with the alleged victim to discuss supportive measures that
             may be appropriate in the particular circumstances and
             explain the process for filing a formal complaint.

             a.  Supportive measures are individualized measures
                 designed to ensure the employee can continue to access
                 and perform their work (such as requiring no contact
                 between individuals, temporarily moving work locations
                 or changing schedules, etc.).

             b.  Supportive measures may be continued even if the
                 alleged victim chooses not to file a formal complaint,
                 if appropriate under the particular circumstances.

         3.  The school cannot provide an informal resolution process
             for resolving a report until a formal complaint is filed.

         4.  Employees will not be retaliated against for reporting
             sexual harassment, or for participating in an
             investigation. Retaliation is illegal under federal and
             state nondiscrimination laws, and any retaliation will
             result in disciplinary actions, up to and including
             discharge.

         5.  Any employee who believes they have been the victim of
             sexual harassment is encouraged to utilize the school's
             complaint procedures. However, employees are hereby
             notified that they also have the right to report sexual
             harassment to the Maine Human Rights Commission, 51 State
             House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333 (telephone:
             207-624-6290) and/or to the federal Office for Civil
             Rights, U.S. Department of Education, 5 Post Office Square,
             8th Floor, Boston, MA 02109-3921 (telephone: 617-289-0111).

         6.  The Executive Director shall be informed of all reports and
             formal complaints of sexual harassment.

     B.  How to Make A Formal Complaint

         1.  An alleged victim may file a formal written complaint
             requesting investigation of alleged Title IX sexual
             harassment. The written complaint must include basic
             information concerning the allegation of sexual harassment
             (i.e., date, time, location, individual(s) who alleged
             engaged in sexual harassment, description of allegation).
             Employees who need assistance in preparing a formal written
             complaint, are encouraged to consult with the AAO/Title IX
             Coordinator.

         2.  In certain circumstances, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator may
             file a formal complaint even when the alleged victim
             chooses not to. Examples include if the respondent (person
             alleged to have engaged in sexual harassment) has been
             found responsible for previous sexual harassment or there
             is a safety threat within the school). In such cases, the
             alleged victim is not a party to the case, but will receive
             notices as required by the Title IX regulations at specific
             points in the complaint process.

         3.  In accordance with the Title IX regulations, the AAO/Title
             IX Coordinator must dismiss a formal complaint under this
             Title IX procedure if: a) the conduct alleged in the formal
             complaint does not constitute sexual harassment under the
             Title IX regulations and this policy; b) if the conduct
             alleged did not occur within the scope of the school's
             education programs and activities, or c) did not occur in
             the United States.

         4.  In accordance with the Title IX regulations, the AAO/Title
             IX Coordinator may dismiss a formal complaint under this
             Title IX procedure if: a) a complainant withdraws the
             formal complaint, or withdraws particular allegations
             within the complaint; b) the respondent is no longer
             employed by the school; or c) there are specific
             circumstances that prevent the school from gathering
             evidence sufficient to reach a determination regarding the
             formal complaint.

         5.  If a formal complaint is dismissed under this Title IX
             procedure, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator will promptly and
             simultaneously send written notices to the parties
             explaining the reasons. Parties have the opportunity to
             appeal dismissals in accordance with subsection I below.

         6.  If the conduct alleged potentially violates other laws,
             Board policies and/or professional expectations, the school
             may address the conduct under Section 2 or another
             applicable policy/procedure.

     C.  Administrative Leave

         The Executive Director may place a respondent on administrative
         leave during the complaint procedure:

         1.  If there is a determination (following an individualized
             safety and risk analysis) that there is an immediate threat
             to the physical health or safety of an individual arising
             from the allegations of sexual harassment. Examples of such
             circumstances might include, but are not limited to, a
             continued threat of violence against a complainant by a
             respondent, or a respondent's threat of self-harm due to
             the allegations.

         2.  The respondent will be provided notice of the
             administrative leave, and will be provided an opportunity
             to challenge the decision following the removal (this is an
             opportunity to be heard, not a hearing). The respondent has
             the burden to demonstrate why the emergency leave was
             unreasonable.

         3.  Any such decision to place an employee on administrative
             leave shall be made in compliance with any applicable
             disability laws, including Section 504 of the
             Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.

     D.  Notice to Parties of Formal Complaint

         1.  The Title IX Coordinator will provide to the parties
             written notice of the formal complaint and allegations of
             sexual harassment potentially constituting prohibited
             conduct under the Title IX regulations and this procedure.
             The notice will include:

             -   Notice regarding the complaint procedure and the
                 availability of an informal resolution process;

             -   Sufficient details known at the time (including
                 identities of parties, if known; the conduct alleged;
                 and the date and location of the alleged incident, if
                 known), with sufficient time to prepare before any
                 initial interview (not less than five business days);

             -   As required by the Title IX regulations, a statement
                 that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the
                 alleged conduct and that a determination of
                 responsibility will be made at the conclusion of the
                 complaint); and that the parties may inspect and review
                 evidence;

             -   Notice that the parties may each have an advisor of
                 their choice (who may be an attorney), and that the
                 parties may inspect and review evidence;

             -   Notice that knowingly making false statements or
                 submitting false information during the complaint
                 procedure is prohibited and may result in disciplinary
                 action; and

             -   Notice of the name of the investigator, with sufficient
                 time (no less than three business days) to raise
                 concerns of conflict of interest or bias.

         2.  If additional allegations become known at a later time,
             notice of the additional allegations will be provided to
             the parties.

         3.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator will discuss supportive
             measures with each party and implement such measures as
             appropriate.

     E.  Informal Resolution Process

         After a formal complaint has been filed, and if the AAO/Title
         IX Coordinator believes the circumstances are appropriate, the
         AAO/Title IX Coordinator may offer the parties the opportunity
         to participate in an informal resolution process to resolve the
         complaint without completing the investigation and
         determination process. Informal resolutions cannot be used to
         resolve a formal complaint where a student is the complainant
         and the respondent is an employee.

         Informal resolutions can take many forms, depending on the
         particular case. Examples include, but are not limited to,
         facilitated discussions between the parties, restorative
         justice, acknowledgment of responsibility by a respondent,
         apologies, disciplinary actions against a respondent or a
         requirement to engage in specific services, or supportive
         measures. Both parties must voluntarily agree in writing to
         participate in an informal resolution process, and either party
         can withdraw from the process at any time. The Executive
         Director must agree to the terms of any informal resolution
         reached between the parties. If an informal resolution
         agreement is reached, it must be signed by both parties and the
         school. Any such signed agreement is final and binding
         according to its terms.

         If an informal resolution process does not resolve the formal
         complaint, nothing from the informal resolution process may be
         considered as evidence in the subsequent investigation or
         determination.

     F.  Investigation

         1.  The complaint will be investigated by a trained internal or
             external individual designated by the Executive Director
             and AAO/Title IX Coordinator. Any complaint about an
             employee who holds a supervisory position shall be
             investigated by a person who is not subject to that
             supervisor's authority. Any complaint about the Executive
             Director should be submitted to the Chair of the Board, who
             should consult with legal counsel concerning the handling
             and investigation of the complaint.

         2.  The investigator shall consult with the AAO/Title IX
             Coordinator as agreed during the investigation process.

         3.  If the complaint is against an employee of the school,
             rights conferred under an applicable collective bargaining
             agreement shall be applied, to the extent they do not
             conflict with the Title IX regulatory requirements.

         4.  Privacy rights of all parties to the complaint shall be
             maintained in accordance with applicable state and federal
             laws.

         5.  The investigator will:

             a.  Meet with each party after they have received
                 appropriate notice of any meeting and its purpose, with
                 sufficient time to prepare.

             b.  Allow parties to have their advisor at all meetings
                 related to the complaint, although advisors may not
                 speak on behalf of a party or interfere with the
                 process.

             c.  Allow parties a reasonable opportunity to identify
                 witnesses and submit favorable and unfavorable
                 evidence.

             d.  Interview witnesses and conduct such other activities
                 that will assist in ascertaining facts (site visits,
                 review of documents, etc.).

             e.  Consider evidence that is relevant and directly related
                 to the allegations in the formal complaint.

             f.  During the course of the investigation, provide both
                 parties with an equal opportunity to inspect and review
                 any evidence that is obtained in the investigation that
                 is directly related to the allegations in the formal
                 complaint (including evidence which the school does not
                 intend to rely upon in reaching a determination of
                 responsibility), and favorable and unfavorable
                 evidence.

             g.  Prior to completion of the investigation report,
                 provide each party and advisor (if any) the evidence
                 subject to inspection and review, and provide the
                 parties with ten business days to submit a written
                 response.

             h.  Consider the parties' written responses to the evidence
                 prior to completing the investigation report.

             i.  Create an investigative report that fairly summarizes
                 relevant evidence and send the report to the parties
                 and advisors (if any), for their review and written
                 responses within ten business days of receipt.

             j.  After receipt of the parties' written responses (if
                 any), forward the investigation report and party
                 responses to the assigned decision maker.

         6.  The investigation shall be concluded within 40 business
             days if practicable. Reasonable extension of time for good
             reason shall be allowed.

     G.  Determination of Responsibility

         1.  The decision maker shall provide the parties with the
             opportunity to submit written, relevant questions that the
             party wants asked of another party or witness within five
             business days of when the decision maker received the
             investigation report and party responses.

             a.  The decision maker shall explain to a party proposing
                 questions if the decision maker excludes a question as
                 not relevant.

         2.  Each party shall be provided the opportunity to review the
             responses of another party and/or witness, and to ask
             limited written follow-up questions within five business
             days of receiving the answers.

         3.  Each party will receive a copy of the responses to any
             follow-up questions.

         4.  The decision maker shall review the investigation report,
             the parties' responses and other relevant materials,
             applying the preponderance of the evidence standard ("more
             likely than not").

         5.  The decision maker shall issue a written determination,
             which shall include the following:

         ```{=html}
         <!-- -->
         ```
         a.  Identification of all the allegations potentially
             constituting sexual harassment as defined in the Title IX
             regulations and this policy;

         b.  A description of the procedural steps taken from receipt of
             the formal complaint through the determination, including
             notifications to the parties, interviews with parties and
             witnesses, site visits, methods used to gather other
             evidence, and meetings held;

         c.  A determination regarding responsibility as to each
             allegation and findings of fact supporting the
             determinations;

         d.  A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to each
             allegation, including a determination regarding
             responsibility, any disciplinary sanctions the school
             imposes on the respondent, and whether remedies designed to
             restore or preserve equal access to the school's programs
             and activities will be provided to the complainant;

         e.  The school's appeal procedure and permissible bases for the
             parties to appeal the determination.

         ```{=html}
         <!-- -->
         ```
         6.  The written determination shall be provided to the parties
             simultaneously. The determination concerning responsibility
             becomes final either on the date that the school provides
             the parties with the written determination of the results
             of the appeal, if an appeal is filed, or if an appeal is
             not filed, the date on which the appeal would no longer be
             considered timely.

     H.  Remedies, Discipline and Other Actions

         1.  Remedies

             Remedies are measures used to ensure that the complainant
             has equal access to the school's education programs and
             activities following the decision maker's determination.
             Such remedies may include supportive measures, and may
             include other appropriate measures, depending upon the
             determination and the needs of the complainant. The Title
             IX Coordinator is responsible for implementing remedies and
             providing any needed assistance to the Complainant.

         2.  Discipline and Other Actions

             The following are examples of the types of disciplinary
             actions that may be imposed on an employee when there is a
             determination that they are responsible for one or more
             violations involving sexual harassment:

             -   Written warning.
             -   Probation.
             -   Demotion.
             -   Suspension without pay.
             -   Discharge.

             The following are examples of other types of actions that
             may be imposed on an employee when there is a determination
             of responsibility:

             -   Performance improvement plan.
             -   Counseling.
             -   Training.
             -   Loss of leadership/stipend position.

     I.  Appeals

         1.  The parties have the opportunity to appeal a determination
             regarding responsibility, and from dismissals of formal
             complaints. Under the Title IX regulations, appeals are
             allowed on the following grounds:

             a.  A procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of
                 the matter;

             b.  New evidence that was not reasonably available at the
                 time the determination regarding responsibility or
                 dismissal of the formal complaint was made, that could
                 affect the outcome of the matter; or

             c.  The Title IX Coordinator, investigator, or decision
                 maker had a conflict of interest or bias for or against
                 complainants or respondents generally, or the
                 individual complainant or respondent that affected the
                 outcome of the matter.

         2.  An appeal must be filed in writing within five business
             days of receiving the determination, stating the grounds
             for the appeal and including any relevant documentation in
             support of the appeal.

             Appeals submitted after this deadline are not timely and
             shall not be considered.

             a.  Appeals must be filed with the Executive Director, who
                 will consider the appeal.

             b.  The Executive Director shall conduct an impartial
                 review of the appeal, including consideration of the
                 written record of the matter, and may consult with
                 legal counsel or other school officials in making their
                 decision.

             c.  The Executive Director shall issue a written decision
                 describing the result of the appeal and rationale for
                 the result, and provide the written decision
                 simultaneously to the parties. The decision will either
                 deny the appeal, grant the appeal and remand to the
                 decision maker for further consideration, or grant the
                 appeal by revising the disciplinary action(s).

     J.  Records

         Records in connection with sexual harassment reports and the
         complaint process shall be maintained for a minimum of seven
         years.
