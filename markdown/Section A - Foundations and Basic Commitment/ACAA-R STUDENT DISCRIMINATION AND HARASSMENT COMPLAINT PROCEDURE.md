title: STUDENT DISCRIMINATION/HARASSMENT AND TITLE IX SEXUAL HARASSMENT
  COMPLAINT PROCEDURES
---

The Board has adopted these student procedures in order to provide
prompt and equitable resolution of reports and complaints of unlawful
discrimination and harassment of students, including sexual harassment,
as described in policies AC - Nondiscrimination/Equal Opportunity and
Affirmative Action and ACAA - Harassment and Sexual Harassment of
Students.

Complaints alleging unlawful harassment or discrimination against
employees based on a protected category should be addressed through the
Board's Employee Discrimination/Harassment and Title IX Sexual
Harassment Complaint Procedures (ACAB-R).

Any individual who is unsure about whether unlawful discrimination or
harassment has occurred and/or which complaint procedure applies is
encouraged to contact the Affirmative Action Officer/Title IX
Coordinator.

I.  DEFINITIONS

    For purposes of these complaint procedures, the following definitions will be used. The
    Affirmative Action Officer/Title IX Coordinator shall assess all reports and complaints to
    ensure that they are addressed under the appropriate policy and complaint procedure.

    A.  Discrimination/Harassment Complaint Procedure Definitions

        1.  “Discrimination or harassment”: Discrimination or harassment on
        the basis of an individual’s membership in a protected category,
        which, for students, includes race, color, sex, sexual orientation,
        gender identity, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability.

        2.  “Discrimination”: Treating individuals differently, or interfering with
        or preventing them from enjoying the advantages or privileges
        afforded to others because of their membership in a protected
        category.

        3.  “Harassment”: Oral, written, graphic, electronic or physical conduct
        relating to an individual’s actual or perceived membership in a
        protected category that is sufficiently severe, pervasive or persistent
        so as to interfere with or limit that individual’s ability to participate
        in the school’s programs or activities by creating a hostile,
        intimidating or offensive environment.

        4.  “Sexual harassment”: Under Maine law, this means unwelcome
        sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or
        physical conduct of a sexual nature in the following situations:

            a.  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
            implicitly a term or condition of a student’s educational
            benefits;

            b.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a student is
            used as the basis for decisions on educational benefits; or

            c.  Such conduct has the purpose and effect of substantially
            interfering with a student’s academic performance or creates
            an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.

        5.  “Sexual orientation”: Under Maine law, this means a person’s
        “actual or perceived heterosexuality, bisexuality, homosexuality or
        gender identity or expression.”

        6.  “Gender identity”: Under Maine law, this means “the gender-related
        identity, appearance, mannerisms or other gender-related
        characteristics of an individual, regardless of the individual’s
        assigned sex at birth.”

        7.  “Complaint” is defined as an allegation that a student has been
        discriminated against or harassed on the basis of race, color, sex,
        sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, ancestry, national origin
        or disability (and not otherwise addressed in the Title IX regulations
        and Section 3 of ACAA-R).

        8.  Complaints of bullying not involving the protected categories or
        definitions described above may be addressed under Board Policy
        JICK - Bullying and Cyberbullying of Students.

    B.  Title IX Sexual Harassment Complaint Procedure Definitions

        1.  “Sexual Harassment”: 
        
            Under the federal Title IX regulations, sexual
            harassment includes the following conduct on the basis of sex which
            takes place within the context of the school’s education programs
            and activities:

            a.  “Quid pro quo” sexual harassment by a school employee:
            Conditioning a school aid, benefit or service (such as a better
            grade or a college recommendation) on an individual’s
            participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;

            b.  “Hostile environment” sexual harassment: Unwelcome
            conduct based on sex that a reasonable person would
            determine is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive
            that it effectively denies an individual’s equal access to the
            school’s education programs and activities; or

            c.  Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and
            stalking as these terms are defined in federal laws.

        2.  “Report”: 
        
            Under the Title IX regulations, any individual may make a
            report of sexual harassment involving a student, whether the
            individual is the alleged victim or not. School employees are
            required to report possible incidents of sexual harassment involving
            a student. A report must be made to the Affirmative Action
            Officer/Title IX Coordinator. A report triggers certain actions by the
            AAO/Title IX Coordinator for the alleged victim of sexual
            harassment, but an investigation is not conducted unless a “Formal
            Complaint” is filed.

        3.  “Formal Complaint”: 
        
            Under the Title IX regulations, the alleged
            victim of sexual harassment can file a written complaint that triggers
            the complaint procedure in Section 3 of ACAA-R. Only a student
            and/or their parent/legal guardian (and in certain circumstances, the
            AAO/Title IX Coordinator) may file a formal complaint.

        4.  “Student”:

            For the purposes of this procedure, a student is an
            individual who is enrolled or participating in the school’s education
            programs and activities, or is attempting to enroll or participate.

II. DISCRIMINATION/HARASSMENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURE

    This procedure should be used for any complaint of unlawful
    harassment or discrimination complaint based on a protected category
    which does not involve Title IX sexual harassment (which is
    addressed in Section 3).

    A.  How to Make A Complaint

        1.  School employees are required to promptly make a report to
            the AAO/Title IX Coordinator if they have reason to believe
            that a student has been discriminated against or harassed.

        2.  Students (and others) who believe that they, or another
            student has been harassed or discriminated against should
            report their concern promptly to the AAO/Title IX
            Coordinator.

        3.  The individual making the report must provide basic
            information in writing concerning the allegation of
            harassment or discrimination (i.e., date, time, location,
            individual(s) who allegedly engaged in harassment or
            discrimination, description of allegation) to the AAO/Title
            IX Coordinator.

        4.  If an individual is unsure as to whether unlawful
            discrimination or harassment has occurred, or who need
            assistance in preparing a written complaint, they are
            encouraged to discuss the matter with the AAO/Title IX
            Coordinator.

        5.  Individuals will not be retaliated against for reporting
            suspected discrimination or harassment, or for participating
            in an investigation. Retaliation is illegal under federal
            and state nondiscrimination laws, and any retaliation will
            result in disciplinary action, up to and including discharge
            for employees, and expulsion for students.

        6.  Individuals are encouraged to utilize the school's complaint
            procedure. However, individuals are hereby notified that
            they also have the right to report incidents of
            discrimination or harassment to the Maine Human Rights
            Commission, 51 State House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333
            (telephone: 207-624-6290) and/or to the federal Office for
            Civil Rights, U.S. Department of Education, 5 Post Office
            Square, 8th Floor, Boston, MA 02109-3921 (telephone:
            617-289-0111).

    B.  Complaint Handling and Investigation

        1.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator will promptly inform the
            Executive Director and the person who is the subject of the
            complaint (respondent) that a complaint has been received.

        2.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator may pursue an informal
            resolution of the complaint with the agreement of the
            parties involved. Any party to the complaint may decide to
            end the informal resolution process and pursue the formal
            process at any point. Any informal resolution is subject to
            the approval of the parties and the Executive Director, who
            shall consider whether the resolution is in the best
            interest of the school and the parties in light of the
            particular circumstances and applicable policies and laws.

        3.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator may implement supportive
            measures to a student to reduce the risk of further
            discrimination or harassment to a student while an
            investigation is pending. Examples of supportive measures
            include, but are not limited to, ordering no contact between
            the individuals involved or changing classes.

        4.  The complaint will be investigated by a trained internal or
            external individual designated by the Executive Director and
            the AAO/Title IX Coordinator. Any complaint about an
            employee who holds a supervisory position shall be
            investigated by a person who is not subject to that
            supervisor's authority. Any complaint about the Executive
            Director should be submitted to the Chair of the Board, who
            should consult with legal counsel concerning the handling
            and investigation of the complaint.

        5.  The investigator shall consult with the AAO/Title IX
            Coordinator as agreed during the investigation process.

        6.  The respondent will be provided with an opportunity to be
            heard as part of the investigation. The complainant shall
            not be required to attend meetings with the respondent, but
            may choose to do so as part of an informal resolution
            process.

        7.  The complainant and the respondent may suggest witnesses to
            be interviewed and/or submit materials they believe are
            relevant to the complaint.

        8.  If the complaint is against an employee of the school, any
            rights conferred under an applicable collective bargaining
            agreement shall be applied.

        9.  Privacy rights of all parties to the complaint shall be
            maintained in accordance with applicable state and federal
            laws.

        10. The investigation shall be completed within 40 business days
            of receiving the complaint, if practicable. Reasonable
            extensions of time for good reason shall be allowed.

        11. The investigator shall provide a written report and findings
            to the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.

    C.  Findings and Subsequent Actions

        1.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator shall consult with the
            Executive Director concerning the investigation and
            findings.

        2.  If there is a finding that discrimination or harassment
            occurred, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator, in consultation with
            the Executive Director shall:

            a.  Determine what remedial action, if any, is required to
                end the discrimination or harassment, remedy its effect
                and prevent recurrence; and

            b.  Determine what disciplinary action should be taken
                against the individual(s) who engaged in discrimination
                or harassment, if any.

        3.  Inform the complainant and the respondent in writing of the
            results of the investigation and its resolution (in
            accordance with applicable state and federal privacy laws).

    D.  Appeals

        1.  After the conclusion of the investigation, the complainant
            or respondent may seek an appeal of the findings solely on
            the basis of either: (a) prejudicial procedural error or (b)
            the discovery of previously unavailable relevant evidence
            that could significantly impact the outcome.

        2.  Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Executive
            Director within five business days after receiving notice of
            the resolution.

        3.  Upon receipt of a valid appeal, the Executive Director shall
            provide notice to the other party, along with an opportunity
            to provide a written statement within five business days.

        4.  The Executive Director shall review the available
            documentation and may conduct further investigation if
            deemed appropriate.

        5.  The Executive Director's decision on the appeal shall be
            provided to the parties within 10 business days, if
            practicable. The Executive Director's decision shall be
            final.

    E.  Records

        The AAO/Title IX Coordinator shall keep a written record of the
        complaint process.

III. TITLE IX SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT PROCEDURE

     This section should be used only for complaints of Title IX sexual
     harassment as defined in Section 1.B.1.

     A.  How to Make A Report

         1.  School employees who have reason to believe that a student
             has been subjected to sexual harassment is required to
             promptly make a report to the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.

         2.  Students, parents/legal guardians or other individuals who
             believe a student has been sexually harassed are encouraged
             to make a report to the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.

         3.  If the individual making the report is the alleged victim,
             or if the alleged victim is identified by the individual
             making the report, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator will meet
             with the alleged victim to discuss supportive measures that
             may be appropriate in the particular circumstances and
             explain the process for filing a formal complaint.

             a.  Supportive measures are individualized measures
                 designed to ensure the student can continue to access
                 educational programs and activities (such as requiring
                 no contact between individuals or changing classes).

             b.  Supportive measures may be continued even if the
                 alleged victim chooses not to file a formal complaint,
                 if appropriate under the particular circumstances.

         4.  The school cannot provide an informal resolution process
             for resolving a report unless a formal complaint is filed.

         5.  Individuals will not be retaliated against for reporting
             sexual harassment, or for participating in an
             investigation. Retaliation is illegal under federal and
             state nondiscrimination laws, and any retaliation will
             result in disciplinary actions, up to and including
             discharge for employees, or expulsion for students.

         6.  Any student (or their parent/legal guardian) who believes
             they have been the victim of sexual harassment is
             encouraged to utilize the school's complaint procedure.
             However, students (and their parents/legal guardians) are
             hereby notified that they also have the right to report
             sexual harassment to the Maine Human Rights Commission, 51
             State House Station, Augusta, Maine 04333 (telephone:
             207-624-6290) and/or to the federal Office for Civil
             Rights, U.S. Department of Education, 5 Post Office Square,
             8th Floor, Boston, MA 02109-3921 (telephone: 617-289-0111).

         7.  The Executive Director shall be informed of all reports and
             formal complaints of sexual harassment.

     B.  How to Make A Formal Complaint

         1.  An alleged student victim and/or their parent/legal
             guardian may file a formal written complaint requesting
             investigation of alleged Title IX sexual harassment. The
             written complaint must include basic information concerning
             the allegation of sexual harassment (i.e., date, time,
             location, individual(s) who allegedly engaged in sexual
             harassment, description of allegation). Students who need
             assistance in preparing a formal written complaint are
             encouraged to consult with the AAO/Title IX Coordinator.

         2.  In certain circumstances, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator may
             file a formal complaint even when the alleged victim
             chooses not to. Examples include if the respondent (person
             alleged to have engaged in sexual harassment) has been
             found responsible for previous sexual harassment or there
             is a safety threat within the school). In such cases, the
             alleged victim is not a party to the case, but will receive
             notices as required by the Title IX regulations at specific
             points in the complaint process.

         3.  In accordance with the Title IX regulations, the AAO/Title
             IX Coordinator must dismiss a formal complaint under this
             Title IX procedure if: a) the conduct alleged in the formal
             complaint does not constitute sexual harassment under the
             Title IX regulations and this policy; or b) if the conduct
             alleged did not occur within the scope of the school's
             education programs and activities, or c) did not occur in
             the United States.

         4.  In accordance with the Title IX regulations, the AAO/Title
             IX Coordinator may dismiss a formal complaint under this
             Title IX procedure if: a) a complainant withdraws the
             formal complaint, or withdraws particular allegations
             within the complaint; b) the respondent is no longer
             employed by or enrolled in the school; or c) there are
             specific circumstances that prevent the school from
             gathering evidence sufficient to reach a determination
             regarding the formal complaint. However, if the conduct
             potentially violates other policies or laws, it may be
             addressed through the applicable Board policy/procedure.

         5.  If a formal complaint is dismissed under this Title IX
             procedure, the AAO/Title IX Coordinator will promptly and
             simultaneously send written notices to the parties
             explaining the reasons. Parties have the opportunity to
             appeal dismissals in accordance with subsection I below.

         6.  If the conduct alleged in a formal complaint potentially
             violates other laws, Board policies and/or professional
             expectations, the school may address the conduct under
             Section 2 or another applicable Board policy/procedure.

     C.  Emergency Removal or Administrative Leave

         The Executive Director may remove a student from education
         programs and activities on an emergency basis, or place an
         employee on administrative leave during the complaint
         procedure:

         1.  If there is a determination (following an individualized
             safety and risk analysis) that there is an immediate threat
             to the physical health or safety of an individual arising
             from the allegations of sexual harassment. Examples of such
             circumstances might include, but are not limited to, a
             continued threat of violence against a complainant by a
             respondent, or a respondent's threat of self-harm due to
             the allegations.

         2.  The respondent (and in the case of a student, their
             parent/legal guardian) will be provided notice of the
             emergency removal or administrative leave, and will be
             provided an opportunity to challenge the decision following
             the removal. (This is an opportunity to be heard, not a
             hearing.) The respondent has the burden to demonstrate why
             the emergency removal or administrative leave was
             unreasonable.

         3.  Any such decision shall be made in compliance with any
             applicable disability laws, including the Individuals with
             Disabilities Education Act, Section 504 of the
             Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.

     D.  Notice to Parties of Formal Complaint

         1.  The Title IX Coordinator will provide to the parties
             written notice of the formal complaint and allegations of
             sexual harassment potentially constituting prohibited
             conduct under the Title IX regulations and this procedure.
             The notice shall include:

             -   Notice regarding the complaint procedure and the
                 availability of an informal resolution process;

             -   Sufficient details known at the time (including
                 identities of parties, if known; the conduct alleged;
                 and the date and location of the alleged incident, if
                 known), with sufficient time to prepare before any
                 initial interview (not less than five business days);

             -   As required by the Title IX regulations, a statement
                 that the respondent is presumed not responsible for the
                 alleged conduct and that a determination of
                 responsibility will be made at the conclusion of the
                 complaint); and that the parties may inspect and review
                 evidence;

             -   Notice that the parties may each have an advisor of
                 their choice (who may be an attorney), and that the
                 parties may inspect and review evidence;

             -   Notice that knowingly making false statements or
                 submitting false information during the complaint
                 process is prohibited and may result in disciplinary
                 action;

             -   Notice of the name of the investigator, with sufficient
                 time (no less than three business days) to raise
                 concerns of conflict of interest or bias.

         2.  If additional allegations become known at a later time,
             notice of the additional allegations will be provided to
             the parties.

         3.  The AAO/Title IX Coordinator will discuss supportive
             measures with each party and implement such measures as
             appropriate.

     E.  Informal Resolution Process

         After a formal complaint has been filed, and if the AAO/Title
         IX Coordinator believes the circumstances are appropriate, the
         AAO/Title IX Coordinator may offer the parties the opportunity
         to participate in an informal resolution process to resolve the
         complaint without completing the investigation and
         determination process. Informal resolutions cannot be used to
         resolve a formal complaint where a student is the complainant
         and the respondent is an employee.

         Informal resolutions can take many forms, depending on the
         particular case. Examples include, but are not limited to,
         facilitated discussions between the parties, restorative
         justice, acknowledgment of responsibility by a respondent,
         apologies; disciplinary actions against a respondent or a
         requirement to engage in specific services, or supportive
         measures. Both parties must voluntarily agree in writing to
         participate in an informal resolution process, and either party
         can withdraw from the process at any time. The Executive
         Director must agree to the terms of any informal resolution
         reached between the parties. If an informal resolution
         agreement is reached, it must be signed by both parties and the
         school. Any such signed agreement is final and binding
         according to its terms.

         If an informal resolution process does not resolve the formal
         complaint, nothing from the informal resolution process may be
         considered as evidence in the subsequent investigation or
         determination.

     F.  Investigation

         1.  The complaint will be investigated by a trained internal or
             external individual designated by the Executive Director
             and AAO/Title IX Coordinator. Any complaint about an
             employee who holds a supervisory position shall be
             investigated by a person who is not subject to that
             supervisor's authority. Any complaint about the Executive
             Director should be submitted to the Chair of the Board, who
             should consult with legal counsel concerning the handling
             and investigation of the complaint.

         2.  The investigator shall consult with the AAO/Title IX
             Coordinator as agreed during the investigation process.

         3.  If the complaint is against an employee of the school,
             rights conferred under an applicable collective bargaining
             agreement shall be applied, to the extent they do not
             conflict with the Title IX regulatory requirements.

         4.  Privacy rights of all parties to the complaint shall be
             maintained in accordance with applicable state and federal
             laws.

         5.  The investigator will:

             a.  Meet with each party after they have received
                 appropriate notice of any meeting and its purpose, with
                 sufficient time to prepare.

             b.  Allow parties to have their advisor at all meetings
                 related to the complaint, although advisors may not
                 speak on behalf of a party or interfere with the
                 process.

             c.  Allow parties a reasonable opportunity to identify
                 witnesses and submit favorable and unfavorable
                 evidence.

             d.  Interview witnesses and conduct such other activities
                 that will assist in ascertaining facts (site visits,
                 review of documents, etc.).

             e.  Consider evidence that is relevant and directly related
                 to the allegations in the formal complaint.

             f.  During the course of the investigation, provide both
                 parties with an equal opportunity to inspect and review
                 any evidence that is obtained in the investigation that
                 is directly related to the allegations in the formal
                 complaint (including evidence which the school does not
                 intend to rely upon in reaching a determination of
                 responsibility), and favorable and unfavorable
                 evidence.

             g.  Prior to completion of the investigation report,
                 provide each party and advisor (if any) the evidence
                 subject to inspection and review, and provide the
                 parties with ten business days to submit a written
                 response.

             h.  Consider the parties' written responses to the evidence
                 prior to completing the investigation report.

             i.  Create an investigative report that fairly summarizes
                 relevant evidence and send the report to the parties
                 and advisors (if any), for their review and written
                 responses within ten business days of receipt.

             j.  After receipt of the parties' written responses (if
                 any), forward the investigation report and party
                 responses to the assigned decision maker.

         6.  The investigation shall be concluded within 40 business
             days if practicable. Reasonable extension of time for good
             reason shall be allowed.

     G.  Determination of Responsibility

         1.  The decision maker shall provide the parties with the
             opportunity to submit written, relevant questions that the
             party wants asked of another party or witness within five
             business days of when the decision maker received the
             investigation report and party responses.

             a.  The decision maker shall explain to a party proposing
                 questions if the decision maker excludes a question as
                 not relevant.

         2.  Each party shall be provided the opportunity to review the
             responses of another party and/or witness, and to ask
             limited written follow-up questions within five business
             days of receiving the answers.

         3.  Each party will receive a copy of the responses to any
             follow-up questions.

         4.  The decision maker shall review the investigation report,
             the parties' responses and other relevant materials,
             applying the preponderance of the evidence standard ("more
             likely than not").

         5.  The decision maker shall issue a written determination,
             which shall include the following:

             a.  Identification of all the allegations potentially
                 constituting sexual harassment as defined in the Title
                 IX regulations and this policy;

             b.  A description of the procedural steps taken from
                 receipt of the formal complaint through the
                 determination, including notifications to the parties,
                 interviews with parties and witnesses, site visits,
                 methods used to gather other evidence, and meetings
                 held;

             c.  A determination regarding responsibility as to each
                 allegation and findings of fact supporting the
                 determinations;

             d.  A statement of, and rationale for, the result as to
                 each allegation, including a determination regarding
                 responsibility, any disciplinary sanctions the school
                 imposes on the respondent, and whether remedies
                 designed to restore or preserve equal access to the
                 school's programs and activities will be provided to
                 the complainant;

             e.  The school's appeal procedure and permissible bases for
                 the parties to appeal the determination.

         6.  The written determination shall be provided to the parties
             simultaneously. The determination concerning responsibility
             becomes final either on the date that the school provides
             the parties with the written determination of the results
             of the appeal, if an appeal is filed, or if an appeal is
             not filed, the date on which the appeal would no longer be
             considered timely.

     H.  Remedies, Discipline and Other Actions

         1.  Remedies

             Remedies are measures used to ensure that the complainant
             has equal access to the school's education programs and
             activities following the decision maker's determination.
             Such remedies may include supportive measures, and may
             include other appropriate measures, depending upon the
             determination and the needs of the complainant. The Title
             IX Coordinator is responsible for implementing remedies and
             providing any needed assistance to the Complainant.

         2.  Discipline and Other Actions - Students

             The following are of the types of discipline and other
             actions that may be imposed on a student when there is a

             -   Written warning.
             -   Probation.

             -   Counseling.
             -   Training.

     I.  Appeals

         1.  The parties have the opportunity to appeal a determination
             regarding responsibility, and from dismissals of formal
             complaints. Under the Title IX regulations, appeals are
             allowed on the following grounds:

             a.  A procedural irregularity that affected the outcome of
                 the matter;

             b.  New evidence that was not reasonably available at the
                 time the determination regarding responsibility or
                 dismissal of the formal complaint was made, that could
                 affect the outcome of the matter; or

             c.  The Title IX Coordinator, investigator, or decision
                 maker had a conflict of interest or bias for or against
                 complainants or respondents generally, or the
                 individual complainant or respondent that affected the
                 outcome of the matter.

         2.  An appeal must be filed in writing within five business
             days of receiving the determination, stating the grounds
             for the appeal and including any relevant documentation in
             support of the appeal. Appeals submitted after this
             deadline are not timely and shall not be considered.

             a.  Appeals must be filed with the Executive Director, who
                 will consider the appeal.

             b.  The Executive Director shall notify the other party in
                 writing of the appeal and will allow both parties to
                 submit a written statement in support of, or
                 challenging, the determination of the decision maker.

             c.  The Executive Director shall conduct an impartial
                 review of the appeal, including consideration of the
                 written record of the matter, and may consult with
                 legal counsel or other school officials in making their
                 decision.

             d.  The Executive Director shall issue a written decision
                 describing the result of the appeal and rationale for
                 the result, and provide the written decision
                 simultaneously to the parties. The decision will either
                 deny the appeal, grant the appeal and remand to the
                 decision maker for further consideration, or grant the
                 appeal by revising the disciplinary or other action(s).

     J.  Records

         Records in connection with sexual harassment reports and the
         complaint process shall be maintained for a minimum of seven
         years.
