title: HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF SCHOOL EMPLOYEES
---

Harassment of school employees because of race, color, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, religion, ancestry or national origin,
age, genetic information or disability is prohibited. Such conduct is a
violation of Board policy and may constitute illegal discrimination
under state and federal laws.

Any employee who engages in harassment or sexual harassment shall be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.

A.  Harassment

    Harassment includes, but is not limited to, verbal abuse, threats,
    physical assault and/or battery based on race, color, sex, sexual
    orientation, gender identity, religion, ancestry or national origin,
    age, genetic information or disability. Under the Maine Civil Rights
    Act, violence or threats of violence against a person or their
    property based on their sexual orientation are also illegal.

B.  Sexual Harassment

    Sexual harassment is addressed under federal and state laws and
    regulations. The scope and definitions of sexual harassment under
    these laws differ, as described below.

    1.  Title IX Sexual Harassment

        Under the federal Title IX regulations, sexual harassment
        includes the following conduct on the basis of sex which takes
        place within the context of the school's education programs and
        activities:

        a.  "Quid pro quo" sexual harassment by a school employee:
            Conditioning a school aid, benefit or service (such as a
            promotion or favorable evaluation) on an individual's
            participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;

        b.  "Hostile environment" sexual harassment: Unwelcome conduct
            based on sex that a reasonable person would determine is so
            severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it
            effectively denies an individual's equal access to the
            school's education programs and activities; or

        c.  Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and
            stalking as these terms are defined in federal laws.

    2.  Sexual Harassment Under Title VII and Maine Law

        Under another federal law, Title VII, and under Maine
        law/regulations, sexual harassment is defined differently. Maine
        Human Rights Commission regulations define sexual harassment as
        conduct on the basis of sex which satisfies one or more of the
        following:

        a.  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
            implicitly a term or condition of an individual's
            employment;

        b.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an employee is
            used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the
            employee; or

        c.  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably
            interfering with an individual's work performance or
            creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working
            environment.

C.  Reports and Complaints of Harassment or Sexual Harassment

    Any employee who believes they have been harassed or sexually
    harassed is encouraged to make a report to the Affirmative Action
    Officer/Title IX Coordinator. The Affirmative Action Officer/Title
    IX Coordinator is also available to answer questions and provide
    assistance to any individual who is unsure whether harassment or
    sexual harassment has occurred.

    All reports and complaints regarding harassment or sexual harassment
    of employees shall be addressed through the Employee & Third-Party
    Unlawful Discrimination/Harassment and Title IX Sexual Harassment
    Complaint Procedures (ACAB-R).
