title: HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT OF STUDENTS
---

Harassment of students because of race, color, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity, religion, ancestry or national origin, or disability is
prohibited. Such conduct is a violation of Board policy and may
constitute illegal discrimination under state and federal laws.

School employees, fellow students, volunteers, visitors to the schools,
and other persons with whom students may interact in order to pursue or
engage in education programs and activities, are required to refrain
from such conduct.

Harassment and sexual harassment of students by school employees is
considered grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including
discharge. Harassment and sexual harassment of students by other
students is considered grounds for disciplinary action, up to and
including expulsion. The Executive Director will determine appropriate
sanctions for harassment of students by persons other than school
employees and students.

A.  Harassment

    Harassment includes, but is not limited to, verbal abuse and other
    offensive conduct based on race, color, sex, sexual orientation,
    gender identity, religion, ancestry or national origin, or
    disability. Harassment that rises to the level of physical assault,
    battery and/or abuse, and/or bullying behavior are also addressed in
    Board Policies JICIA - Weapons, Violence and School Safety and
    JICK - Bullying.

B.  Sexual Harassment

    Sexual harassment is addressed under federal and state
    laws/regulations. The scope and definitions of sexual harassment
    under these laws differ, as described below.

    1.  TITLE IX SEXUAL HARASSMENT

        Under the federal Title IX regulations, sexual harassment
        includes the following conduct on the basis of sex which takes
        place within the context of the school's education programs and
        activities:

        a.  "Quid pro quo" sexual harassment by a school employee:
            Conditioning a school aid, benefit or service (such as a
            better grade or a college recommendation) on an individual's
            participation in unwelcome sexual conduct;

        b.  "Hostile environment" sexual harassment: Unwelcome conduct
            based on sex that a reasonable person would determine is so
            severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it
            effectively denies an individual's equal access to the
            school's education programs and activities; or

        c.  Sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence and
            stalking as these terms are defined in federal laws.

    2.  Sexual Harassment Under Maine Law

        Under Maine law, sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome
        sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or
        physical conduct of a sexual nature in the following situations:

        a.  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or
            implicitly a term or condition of a student's educational
            benefits;

        b.  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by a student is
            used as the basis for decisions on educational benefits; or

        c.  Such conduct has the purpose and effect of substantially
            interfering with a student's academic performance or creates
            an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment.

C.  Reports and Complaints of Harassment or Sexual Harassment

    All school employees are required to report possible incidents of
    harassment or sexual harassment involving students to the
    Affirmative Action Officer/Title IX Coordinator. Failure to report
    such incidents may result in disciplinary action.

    Students, parents/legal guardians and other individuals are strongly
    encouraged to report possible incidents of harassment or sexual
    harassment involving students to the Affirmative Action
    Officer/Title IX Coordinator.

    The Affirmative Action Officer/Title IX Coordinator is also
    available to answer questions and provide assistance to any
    individual who is unsure whether harassment or sexual harassment has
    occurred.

    All reports and complaints of harassment or sexual harassment
    against students shall be addressed through the Student
    Discrimination/Harassment and Title IX Sexual Harassment Procedures
    (ACAA-R).
