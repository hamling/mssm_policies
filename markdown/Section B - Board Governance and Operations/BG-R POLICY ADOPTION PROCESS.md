title: POLICY ADOPTION PROCESS
---

The following procedure shall be used to develop, adopt, review, revise
and/or delete (repeal) Maine School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM)
Board policies:

A.  The Board's Governance Committee is charged with reviewing and
    recommending all new policies and policy changes to be considered by
    the Board.

    1.  Individual Board members, Board subcommittees, the Executive
        Director, and members of the public may submit policy
        suggestions and concerns directly to the Governance Committee.
        Policy suggestions that are submitted to the Board Chair or the
        Executive Director will be forwarded to the Governance
        Committee. School unit employees should follow any and all
        applicable administrative procedures and/or collective
        bargaining agreement provisions for submitting policy
        suggestions.

    2.  The Governance Committee, together with the Executive Director,
        will be responsible for reviewing and researching suggestions
        for new policies and policy changes. The Governance Committee
        may seek or ask the Executive Director to provide information
        such as, but not limited to, the specific need for the policy;
        the fiscal consequences of the proposed policy; the potential
        effect of the policy on the instructional program, staff,
        students and the community; samples of policies on the same or
        similar subjects; applicable provisions of state and/or federal
        law and regulations; and the anticipated costs and benefits of
        implementing, enforcing and monitoring the proposed policy.

    3.  The Governance Committee may prepare draft policies or delegate
        the drafting of all or individual policies to the Executive
        Director.

    4.  At an appropriate stage in the process, the Executive Director,
        on behalf of the Governance Committee and the Board, shall
        notify the bargaining agent for the school unit's teachers of
        any proposed new educational policy or proposed modification of
        any existing educational policy. The Policy Committee may also
        seek input or discuss the proposal with other groups affected by
        the policy.

    5.  The Governance Committee will make reports to the Board
        regarding its activities and the status of policy development.

B.  Upon recommendation by the Governance Committee, the first reading
    of a new policy, revision or deletion of policy shall be placed on
    the agenda of a regular Board meeting. Board members shall receive
    the policy, supporting material, if appropriate, and any written
    recommendations in advance of the meeting date.

    The Governance Committee Chair will explain the proposed policy or
    policy change. The Board may discuss the substance of the policy
    proposal, and a vote shall be held to acknowledge the first reading
    of the policy. Any changes to the policy agreed to by consensus or
    by vote on a motion to amend shall be made prior to the second
    reading.

C.  At the next regular meeting, the policy shall be placed on the
    agenda for second reading and action. Amendments may be introduced
    and acted upon. If a main motion to approve the policy is not passed
    at such a meeting by a majority vote of Board members present and
    voting, the process for that policy is ended unless the Board, by
    vote, takes action to table further consideration of the policy or
    otherwise dispose of the policy (e.g., refer it back to the
    Governance Committee for further research).

D.  The Executive Director will be responsible for making new and
    revised policies available to board members, school personnel,
    students and the public by updating the school's website and/or
    other appropriate means as soon as practicable following adoption.
