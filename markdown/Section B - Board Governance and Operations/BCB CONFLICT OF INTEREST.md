code: BCB
title: CONFLICT OF INTEREST
---

Board service is a matter of public trust. In making decisions that
affect the Maine School of Science and Mathematics, Board members have
the duty to act in the interest of the common good and for the benefit
of the people they represent.

A conflict of interest may arise when there is an incompatibility
between a Board member's personal or professional interest and his/her
responsibilities as an elected or appointed official in a matter
proposed or pending before the Board. Board members have a legal and
ethical responsibility to avoid not only conflict of interest, but the
appearance of conflict of interest as well.

## Financial Interest

A Board member has a financial interest in a question or contract under
consideration when he/she or a member of his/her immediate family may
derive some financial or other material benefit or loss as a result of
the Board action. Or, a Board member is an owner, executive, or board
member of a business or entity which may derive some financial or other
gain, benefit, or loss as a result of Board action. The vote of the
Board is voidable if a Board member has a financial interest and votes
on that question or is involved in the discussion, negotiation, or award
of a contract or other action in which he/she has a financial interest.

In order to prevent the vote on a question or contract from being
voidable, a Board member who has a financial interest must:

A.  Make full disclosure of his/her interest before any action is taken;
    and

B.  Abstain from voting, from the negotiation or award of the contract,
    and from otherwise attempting to influence the decision.

The Secretary of the Board shall record in the minutes of the meeting
the member's disclosure and abstention from taking part in the decision
in which he/she has an interest.

It is not the intent of this policy to prevent a Board member from
voting or the School from contracting with a business because a Board
member is an employee of that business or has another, indirect interest
but is designed to prevent the placing of Board members in a position
where their interest in the School and their interest in their places of
employment may conflict and to avoid appearances of conflict of
interest.

## Appearance of Conflict of Interest

A Board member should do nothing to give the impression that his/her
position or vote on an issue is influenced by anything other than a fair
consideration of all sides of a question.

Board members shall attempt to avoid the appearance of conflict of
interest by disclosure and/or by abstention.

## Appointment to Office and Other Employment

A voting member of the Board may not, during the time the member serves
on the Board and for one year after the member ceases to serve on the
Board, be appointed to any civil office of profit or employment position
which has been created or the compensation of which has been increased
by action of the Board during the time the member served on the Board.

## Employment

A voting member of the Board or spouse of a voting member may not be an
employee of the School.

## Board Members as Volunteers

A voting member of the Board, or spouse of a voting member, may not
serve as a volunteer when that volunteer has primary responsibility for
a curricular, co-curricular or extracurricular program or activity and
reports directly to the Executive Director or other school administrator
in the School.

Volunteer activities of a member of the Board or member's spouse other
than in roles that are prohibited by this section may be prescribed by
policies developed and approved by the Board.

## Definitions

For the purposes of this policy, the following statutory definitions
apply:

A.  "Employee" means a person who receives monetary payment or benefits,
    no matter the amount paid or hours worked, for personal services
    performed for the School.

B.  "Volunteer" means a person who performs personal services for the
    School without monetary payments or benefits of any kind or amount.
