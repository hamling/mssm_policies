title: NEW BOARD MEMBER ORIENTATION
---

In order that newly elected/appointed Board members may cast informed
votes and function effectively as board members, the Board and
Superintendent will extend to them the fullest measures of courtesy and
cooperation, and will make every reasonable effort to assist newly
elected/appointed Board members in understanding the Board's functions,
policies, procedures and current issues.

A.  In the interim between a new member's election or appointment and
    his/her assuming office, the Board, through the Superintendent, will
    invite newly elected*/*appointed members to attend meetings, except
    those held in executive session, and provide newly elected/appointed
    members with agenda, minutes and reports applicable to those
    meetings. During the time between election or appointment and the
    assumption of office, the status of the future-member remains that
    of a private citizen and not that of an elected or appointed
    official.

B.  The Board, through the Superintendent, will provide new members with
    copies of appropriate publications, such as the Board policy manual,
    student handbook(s), collective bargaining agreements, and current
    budget documents.

C.  The Board Chair will remind Board members of their obligation to
    complete, not later than the 120^th^ day after the date of taking
    the oath of office, training on the requirements of Maine's Freedom
    of Access Law. The Chair will provide Board members with information
    regarding available training options. Each Board member shall attest
    by means of a written or electronic record that he/she has completed
    the training and provide a copy of such record to the
    Superintendent's Office. To facilitate documentation of training,
    the Superintendent will make available to Board members copies of
    the State's sample Certification of Completion of Freedom of Access
    Training form. This training is required after each re-election or
    re-appointment.

D.  The Board will encourage new members to attend appropriate
    orientation and/or boardsmanship workshops. Reimbursement for such
    activities must be approved in advance by the Board Chair, in
    consultation with the Superintendent, and is subject to the
    availability of funds.

E.  The Chair and Superintendent will schedule and arrange for an
    orientation session for new Board members as soon as practicable
    after election or appointment. A reasonable amount of time will be
    provided for discussion of:

    1.  The roles and responsibilities of the Board and individual
        members;

    2.  Basic operational procedures of the Board;

    3.  Placement of items on the agenda;

    4.  The role of committees, subcommittees and advisory committees;

    5.  How and why executive sessions may be held;

    6.  What is considered confidential or privileged information;

    7.  Appropriate responses of an individual member when a request or
        complaint is made directly to him/her by a student, parent or
        member of the community;

    8.  How the Board responds to complaints involving personnel;

    9.  General information about the School and its resources;

    10. How Board members, in fulfilling their duties, may request
        information concerning the School's operations, finances and
        personnel;

    11. How Board members may make arrangements to visit the School and
        the protocol for such visits;

    12. Protocol for dealing with the media; and

    13. Other relevant topics. All Board members will be invited to the
        orientation session and encouraged to attend. The orientation is
        intended to serve as a useful review of basic boardsmanship
        concepts for experienced members, as well as an opportunity to
        provide information and counsel to new Board members.
