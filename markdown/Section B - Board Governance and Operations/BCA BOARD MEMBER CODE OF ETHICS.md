title: BOARD MEMBER CODE OF ETHICS
---

Having accepted the challenge of service on this Board, I accept the
principles set forth in the following code of ethics to guide me in
providing education to all the participants of MSSM's programs.

A.  I will view service on the Board as an opportunity to serve my
    community, state, and nation because I believe public education is
    the best means to promote the welfare of our people and to preserve
    our democratic way of life.

B.  I will at all times think of students first and base my decisions on
    how they will affect students, their education, and their training.

C.  I will make no disparaging remarks, in or out of the Board meetings,
    about other members of the Board or their opinions.

D.  I will remember at all times that as an individual I have no legal
    authority outside the meetings of the Board, and that I will conduct
    my relationship with MSSM staff, my constituents, and all media of
    communications on the basis of this fact.

E.  I will recognize that my responsibility is not to operate MSSM but
    to see that it is well-operated.

F.  I will seek to provide education for all students at MSSM
    commensurate with their needs and abilities.

G.  I will listen to all constituents but will refer all complaints to
    the proper authorities, and will discuss such complaints only at a
    regular meeting after failure of administrative solution.

H.  I will support a decision made by the majority of the Board
    graciously.

I.  I will not criticize employees publicly, but will make such
    criticism to the Executive Director for investigation and action, if
    necessary.

J.  I will make decisions openly after all facts bearing on a question
    have been presented and discussed.

K.  I will refuse to make promises as to how I will vote on a matter
    that should properly come before the Board as a whole.

L.  I will not discuss the confidential business of the Board in my
    home, on the street, or in my office; the place for such discussion
    being the Board meeting.

M.  I will confine my Board action to those duties and powers listed in
    Title 20-A ยง8205 save those delegated by the Board to the
    administration, leaving the administration of MSSM to the Executive
    Director.

N.  I will welcome and encourage cooperation and participation by
    teachers, administrators, and other personnel in developing policies
    that affect their welfare and that of the students they serve.

O.  I will endeavor at all times to see that MSSM has adequate financial
    support within the capabilities of the community and State, in order
    that every student may receive the best possible education.

P.  I will resist every temptation and outside pressure to use my
    position as a Board member to benefit myself or any individual or
    agency apart from the total interest of MSSM.

Q.  I will endeavor to attend every regular and special Board meeting
    recognizing that my presence means representation for my
    constituents. If I find that this is not possible for an extended
    length of time, I will give consideration to resigning from my
    position on the Board.

R.  I will recognize at all times that the Board of which I am a member
    is an agent of the State, and as such, I will abide by the
    Constitution and laws of the State.
