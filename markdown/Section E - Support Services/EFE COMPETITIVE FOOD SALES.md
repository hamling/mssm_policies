title: COMPETITIVE FOOD SALES -- SALES OF FOODS IN COMPETITION WITH THE
  SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE PROGRAM
---

MSSM supports good nutrition as part of a school environment that
contributes to student health and encourages positive food choices and
eating habits. The MSSM Board of Trustees believes that nutrition
influences a student's ability to take full advantage of MSSM's
educational program and is, therefore, related to student achievement.

The Board of Trustees also recognizes that proceeds from the sale of
foods and beverages outside of MSSM's food program ("competitive foods")
are a significant source of funds for student activities that MSSM might
not otherwise be able to provide.

The Board of Trustees has adopted this policy to govern the sale of
foods and beverages on School property.

I.  **RESTRICTION ON SALE OF COMPETITIVE FOODS**

    Any food or beverage sold at any time on School property shall be a
    planned part of the total food service program of the school and
    shall include only those items which contribute both to the
    nutritional needs of children and the development of desirable food
    habits, and shall not include foods of minimal nutritional value as
    defined in applicable federal regulations, except as provided for by
    Board policy in certain circumstances.

    The Board of Trustees permits the sale of food and beverages outside
    the total food program:

    A.  To School staff;

    B.  To attendees at School-sponsored community events held on School
        property (i.e., School-sponsored events that are open to the
        public);

    C.  To the public at community events held on School property in
        accordance with the Board's facilities use policy;

    D.  By a School-approved student organization or program if
        consistent with the requirement that such sales not include
        foods of minimal nutritional value as defined in 7 C.F.R.
        ยง210.11(a)(2). This policy applies to sales of foods and
        beverages at any time on School property by any person, group or
        organization.

    When foods and beverages are sold to attendees at community events
    sponsored by the School or held on School property, students, staff,
    parents, or School-sponsored organizations involved in such sales
    are encouraged to include at least some healthy food choices.

II. **FUNDS FROM SALES OF COMPETITIVE FOODS**

    Funds from all food and beverage sales made at any time on School
    property shall accrue to the benefit of the School's food service
    program, except that funds raised through authorized sales outside
    the total food service program shall accrue to the sponsoring School
    or approved student organization in accordance with applicable
    policies, cash-management procedures and administrative directives,
    or to the sponsor of a community event that is held on School
    property in accordance with the Board of Trustees' facilities use
    policy.

    The Executive Director has broad discretion in determining when a
    sponsor of an event is an "approved student organization" and when
    an activity is a School-sponsored event.

    Foods of minimal nutritional value may be sold by approved student
    organizations when an event held on school property is open to the
    public. However, students may not sell foods of minimal nutritional
    value if an event is not open to the public. Boosters may also sell
    foods of minimal nutritional value if the event is open to the
    public. Community events that are sponsored by non-School groups
    ("outside organizations" such as Kiwanis, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts,
    Little League, other community organizations) are events over which
    the School has no authority or responsibility other than through the
    Board of Trustees' facilities use policy and procedures that
    implement the facilities use policy. Funds raised by these groups
    will accrue to the organization.

III. **DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY**

     The Executive Director/designee shall be responsible for
     enforcement of this policy. A School employee who observes conduct
     he/she believes to be a violation of this policy or is informed of
     such conduct by a parent, student, or community member shall
     contact an administrator or the Executive Director/designee.
