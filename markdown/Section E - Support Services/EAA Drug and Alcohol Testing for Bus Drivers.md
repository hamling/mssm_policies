title: Drug and Alcohol Testing for Bus Drivers
---

In accordance with federal law and regulations,MSSM shall be responsible
for implementing a drug and alcohol testing program for school bus
drivers in its employ. The purpose of the testing program shall be to
help prevent accidents and injuries resulting from the misuse of alcohol
and controlled substances by bus drivers.

## Prohibited Conduct

Drivers shall be prohibited from any alcohol misuse that could affect
performance on the job; including use on the job, use during the four
hours before driving, having prohibited concentrations of alcohol in
their systems while driving, and use during eight hours following an
accident.

No driver shall report for duty or remain on duty requiring the
performance of safety-sensitive functions when the driver uses any
controlled substances except when the use is pursuant to the
instructions of a physician who has advised the driver that the
substance does not adversely affect his ability to safely operate a
motor vehicle.

## Required Testing

Drivers shall be subject to pre-employment/pre-duty drug testing and to
reasonable suspicion, random post-accident, return-to-duty and follow-up
alcohol and drug testing pursuant to procedures set out in the federal
regulations. These procedures use an evidential breath testing device
for alcohol testing. For controlled substances testing, urine specimen
collection and testing by a laboratory certified by the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services shall be required.

Pre-employment drug testing shall be administered to an applicant
offered a position prior to the first time the driver performs a
safety-sensitive function for MSSM. Random alcohol testing shall be
limited to the time period surrounding the performance of safety-related
functions which includes just before or just after the employee performs
the safety-related function. Controlled substances testing may be
performed at any time while the driver is at work. An employee covered
by the federal regulations may not refuse to take a required test.

## Consequences if Testing Indicates Drug or Alcohol Misuse

If the testing confirms prohibited alcohol concentration levels or the
presence of a controlled substance, the employee shall be removed
immediately from safety-related functions in accordance with the federal
regulations. Before a driver is reinstated, if at all, the driver shall
undergo an evaluation by a substance abuse professional, comply with any
required rehabilitation, and undergo a return-to-duty test with verified
test results.

A driver who is prohibited from performing safety-sensitive functions
may be assigned to non-safety-sensitive functions until such time as the
driver complies with the requirements for returning to duty.

The MSSM Board of Trustees retains the authority consistent with state
and federal law to discipline or discharge any employee who is an
alcoholic or chemical dependent and whose current use of alcohol or
drugs affects the employee's qualifications for and performance of his
job.

MSSM is not required under federal law requiring drug and alcohol
testing to provide rehabilitation, pay for substance abuse treatment, or
to reinstate the employee. All employment decisions involving
reinstatement, termination, or dismissal shall be made in accordance
with applicable policies.

## Record Retention

MSSM shall maintain records in compliance with the federal regulations
in a secure location with controlled access. With the driver's consent,
MSSM may obtain any of the information concerning drug and alcohol
testing from the driver's previous employer. A driver shall be entitled
upon written request to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the
driver's use of alcohol or controlled substances including information
pertaining to alcohol or drug tests.

Records shall be made available to a subsequent employer upon receipt of
a written request from a driver only as expressly authorized by the
terms of the driver's request.

## Other Provisions

MSSM shall take steps to insure that administrators receive proper
training to administer the drug and alcohol testing program and those
employees receive the notifications required by federal regulations.
