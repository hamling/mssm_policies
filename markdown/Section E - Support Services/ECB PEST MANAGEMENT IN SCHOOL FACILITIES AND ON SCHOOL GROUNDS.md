title: PEST MANAGEMENT IN SCHOOL FACILITIES AND ON SCHOOL GROUNDS
---

MSSM Board of Trustees recognizes that structural and landscape pests
can pose significant problems for MSSM employees, students, and
property; but the MSSM Board of Trustees also realize that use of some
pesticides may themselves pose health and safety risks to visitors,
employees, students, property, and the environment.

It is therefore the policy of MSSM to incorporate Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) principles and procedures for the control of structural
and landscape pests. A copy of this policy shall be kept on MSSM's
website and made available upon request to staff, parents, students, and
the public.

IPM is a systematic approach to pest management that combines a variety
of methods for managing pests; including monitoring, improved
horticultural, sanitation and food storage practices, pest exclusion and
removal, biological control, and pesticides.

For the purpose of this policy, "pests" are populations of living
organisms (animals, plants, or microorganisms) that interfere with use
of MSSM facilities and grounds. "Pesticide" is defined as any substance
or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling,
or mitigating any pests and any substance and/or mixture of substances
intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant.

The objective of MSSM's IPM program is to provide effective pest control
while minimizing pesticide use. The goals of the IPM program include
managing pests to reduce any potential hazards to human health;
preventing loss or damage to MSSM structures or property; preventing
pests from spreading beyond the site of infestation to other MSSM
property; and enhancing the quality of life for students, staff, and
others. These goals will be addressed by the establishment of a Pest
Management Plan (PMP).

The Executive Director and/or his/her designee shall develop and
implement a PMP consistent with the following IPM principles and
procedures.

A.  Appointment of an IPM Coordinator

    The Executive Director/designee will appoint an IPM Coordinator for
    MSSM. The IPM Coordinator will be the primary contact for pest
    control matters and will be responsible for overseeing the
    implementation of the IPM plan, including making pest control
    decisions.

B.  The IPM Coordinator will:

    Consult with the Building Administrator (BA) and/or Executive
    Director before a decision is made to do a pesticide application
    (for which notice is required) before providing notification of the
    planned application.

C.  The IPM Coordinator's responsibilities will include:

    1.  Recording and monitoring data and pest sightings by MSSM staff
        and students;

    2.  Coordinating pest management with pest control contractors;

    3.  Meeting with pesticide applicators to share information about
        pest problems in MSSM school buildings and on School grounds;

    4.  Recording and ensuring that maintenance and sanitation
        recommendations are carried out where feasible;

    5.  Ensuring that any pesticide use is done according to MSSM's Pest
        Management Plan and Chapter 27 Me. Dept. of Agriculture Board of
        Pesticides Control Rules ("Standards for Pesticide Applications
        and Public Notification in Schools");

    6.  Making MSSM's pest management policy available in all MSSM
        buildings;

    7.  Having available for parents and staff a copy of the Maine
        regulation pertaining to pesticide applications the School
        (Chapter 27 Me. Dept. of Agriculture Board of Pesticides Control
        Rules "Standards for Pesticide Applications and Public
        Notification in Maine Schools") and a record of prior pesticide
        applications and information about the pesticides used.

    8.  Evaluating MSSM's progress in implementing the IPM plan;

    9.  Initiating and coordinating notification of parents and staff of
        pesticide applications according to MSSM's notification
        procedure, and posting notification signs as appropriate; and

    10. Recording all pesticides used by either a professional
        applicator or MSSM staff and/or maintaining all other pest
        control data.

D.  Identification of Specific Pest Thresholds

    Routine inspection and accurate identification of pests are needed
    to recognize potential problems and determine when action should be
    taken. An "action threshold" for specific sites should be determined
    on a case-by-case basis by the IPM Coordinator in consultation with
    the Executive Director/designee, and if necessary, with the advice
    of a professional pest control expert.

    As pest management objectives will differ from site to site
    (e.g. maintaining healthy turf and specific playing surfaces on
    athletic fields, carpenter ant control in buildings, maintenance of
    ornamental plants, etc.), differences should be considered before
    setting an action threshold.

E.  Pesticide Applicators

    Any person who applies pesticides in any School buildings and/or on
    School grounds must possess a Maine pesticide applicators license
    and shall be trained in the principles and practices of IPM. All
    pesticide use must be approved by MSSM's IPM Coordinator.
    Applicators must follow state regulations, pesticide label
    precautions, and must comply with the IPM policy and pest management
    plan.

F.  Selection, Use, and Storage of Pesticides

    Pesticides should be used only when needed. Non-chemical pest
    management methods will be implemented whenever possible to provide
    the desired control. The choice of using a pesticide will be based
    on a review of other available options (sanitation, exclusion,
    mechanical means, trapping, biological control) and a determination
    that these options have not worked or are not feasible. When it has
    been determined that a pesticide must be used to achieve pest
    management goals, the least hazardous effective pesticide should be
    selected. Application should be conducted in a manner that, to the
    extent practicable using currently available technology, minimizes
    human risk. Decisions concerning the particular pesticide to be used
    and the timing of pesticide application should take into
    consideration the use of the buildings or grounds to be treated.
    Pesticide purchases should be limited to the amount expected to be
    used for a specific application or during the year. Pesticides will
    be stored and disposed of in accordance with label directions and
    state and federal regulations. Pesticides must be stored in an
    appropriate, secured location not accessible to students or
    unauthorized personnel.

G.  Notification of Students, Staff, Campers, and Parents of Use of
    Pesticides

    A notice will be provided to MSSM staff, students, campers, and
    parents within the first two (2) weeks of each school year or summer
    camp session, briefly explaining MSSM's IPM/pesticide use policy and
    indicating that pesticides may be used indoors and/or outdoors, as
    needed. When appropriate, MSSM will notify staff, including the
    school nurse, students, campers, and parents/guardians at least
    five (5) days in advance of planned pesticide treatments in the
    School or on School grounds; including playgrounds and playing
    fields. When required by regulations, signs will be posted at each
    point of access to the treated area and in a common area of the
    School at least two (2) working days prior to the application and
    for at least 48 hours following the application in accordance with
    applicable Maine Board of Pesticides Control regulations.

H.  Recordkeeping

    When a pesticide has been used, records pertinent to the application
    including labels and material safety data sheets (MSDS) will be
    maintained at a designated central location at the School for two
    years following application. Records are to be completed on the day
    the pesticide is applied. Pest surveillance records should be
    maintained to verify the need for additional pesticide treatments.
