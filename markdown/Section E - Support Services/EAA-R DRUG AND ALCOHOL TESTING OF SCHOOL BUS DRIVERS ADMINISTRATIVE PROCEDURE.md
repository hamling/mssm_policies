title: DRUG AND ALCOHOL TESTING OF SCHOOL BUS DRIVERS ADMINISTRATIVE
  PROCEDURE
---

The Maine School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM) Board of Trustees,
hereinafter referred to as the "Board," is committed to the
establishment of an alcohol and controlled substance testing program
that meets all applicable requirements of the federal Omnibus
Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, in addition to pertinent
state laws and regulations. The purpose of the testing program shall be
to help prevent accidents and injuries resulting from the misuse of
alcohol and controlled substances by drivers performing safety-sensitive
functions.

The following administrative procedure represents a summary of the main
provisions found in federal regulations promulgated to effectuate drug
and alcohol testing of bus drivers. The following procedure in no way
attempts to modify said regulations, which should always be referred to
when questions as to implementation of this policy/procedure arise.

I.  **APPLICABILITY** All persons operating a commercial motor vehicle
    in commerce in any state and subject to the commercial driver's
    license requirements mandated under both federal and state laws,
    including the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991,
    shall be subject to the drug and alcohol testing provisions herein
    contained.

II. **IMPLEMENTATION** The Executive Director shall be responsible for
    implementing a drug and alcohol-testing program which complies with
    procedures set forth in Title 49 Parts 40, 382, 390 and 395 of the
    Federal Code of Regulations. Such testing program shall include
    pre-employment/pre-duty drug testing, post-accident testing, random
    testing, reasonable suspicion testing, return-to-duty and follow-up
    testing. MSSM shall provide parties subject to testing with written
    notice of materials and information available to them as required by
    Part 382.

    Bid specifications and contracts for transportation shall require
    that the contractor establish a drug and alcohol-testing program
    which complies with federal regulations and that is acceptable to
    the Board.

III. **CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES** Controlled substances in this
     policy/procedure refer to those covered by the Omnibus
     Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, including marijuana,
     cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP).

IV. **SAFETY-SENSITIVE FUNCTION** Safety-sensitive function(s) in this
    policy/procedure refer to functions defined in 49 CFR ยง382.107 and
    ยง395.2 (On-Duty Time, paragraphs (1) through (6)).

V.  **PROHIBITIONS** All drivers subject to this policy shall be
    prohibited from:

    A. Using any alcohol while on duty and four (4) hours prior to going
    on duty;

    B.  Possessing alcohol while on duty;

    C.  Reporting for duty or remaining on duty while having an alcohol
        concentration of 0.02 or greater;

    D.  Using any alcohol for eight (8) hours following an accident, or
        until he/she undergoes a post-accident alcohol test, whichever
        occurs first;

    E.  Refusing to submit to a required alcohol or controlled substance
        test(s);

    F.  Reporting for duty or remaining on duty when using any
        controlled substance, except when use is pursuant to the
        instructions of a physician who advised the driver that the
        substance does not adversely affect the driver's ability to
        safely operate the vehicle; and

    G.  Reporting for duty, remaining on duty, or performing a
        safety-sensitive function, if the driver tests positive for a
        controlled substance.

VI. **REQUIRED TESTING**

    A.  Pre-Employment Testing Prior to the first time a driver performs
        a safety-sensitive function MSSM, the driver shall undergo
        testing for controlled substances. However, no driver shall be
        subjected to pre-employment controlled substance testing prior
        to having been offered a position. Employment is conditioned
        upon a verified negative controlled substance test result.

    B.  Post-Accident Testing As soon as practicable following an
        accident, each surviving driver will be subject to alcohol and
        controlled substance testing as follows:

        1.  Any driver performing safety-sensitive functions with
            respect to the vehicle if the accident involved loss of
            human life;

        2.  Any driver who receives a citation under State or local law
            for a moving violation arising from the accident; and

            a.  Causes bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the
                injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from
                the scene of the accident; or

            b.  Should one or more motor vehicles incurring disabling
                damage as a result of the accident, require a motor
                vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a tow
                truck or other motor vehicle.

        3.  In addition, the following provisions will also apply.

            a.  Alcohol

                If a test required under this section is not
                administered within two (2) hours following the
                accident, MSSM shall prepare and maintain on file a
                record stating the reasons the test was not promptly
                administered. If a test is not administered within
                eight (8) hours following the accident, MSSM shall cease
                attempts to administer the test and shall prepare and
                maintain the same record. Records shall be submitted to
                the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) upon request
                of the Associate Administrator.

            b.  Controlled Substances

                If a test required by this section is not administered
                within thirty-two (32) hours following the accident,
                MSSM shall cease attempts to administer the test and
                shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the
                reasons the test was not promptly administered. Records
                shall be submitted to the FHWA upon request of the
                Associate Administrator.

    C.  Random Testing

        All drivers subject to this policy/procedure will be subject to
        random and unannounced alcohol and controlled substance testing
        throughout the year. The minimum annual percentage rate for
        testing of bus drivers is as follows:

        1.  Random alcohol testing shall be a minimum of 10 percent of
            the number of driver positions each selection period; and

        2.  Random controlled substance testing shall be a minimum of 50
            percent of the number of driver positions each selection
            period.

    D.  Reasonable Suspicion Testing

        All drivers subject to this policy/procedure shall submit to
        alcohol and controlled substance testing when the employer has
        reasonable suspicion to believe that the driver has violated the
        prohibitions found in Part V of this procedure, with the
        exception of Part V.B. regarding alcohol possession. MSSM shall
        base its determination that reasonable suspicion exists
        requiring the driver to undergo such testing on observations
        concerning appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the
        driver. When controlled substances are at issue, observations
        may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of
        controlled substances.

        In addition, the following provisions also apply:

        1.  Alcohol

            Alcohol testing will be performed only if the aforementioned
            observations are made during, just preceding, or just after
            the period of the workday that the driver is required to be
            in compliance with this policy/procedure. If a test required
            under this section is not administered within two (2) hours
            following the reasonable suspicion determination, MSSM shall
            prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons
            the test was not promptly administered. If a test required
            under this section is not administered within eight (8)
            hours following a determination that reasonable suspicion
            exists, MSSM shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol
            test and shall state in the record reasons for not
            administering the test. MSSM shall submit to the FHWA
            records of tests required by this section that were not
            completed within eight (8) hours according to the mandates
            of 49 CFR ยง382.307 (3).

        2.  Controlled Substances

            MSSM shall, within twenty-four (24) hours or before the
            results of the controlled substances test are released,
            whichever is earlier, create a written record of the
            observations leading to a controlled substances test which
            shall be signed by the administrator or MSSM official making
            said observations.

    E.  Return-to-Duty Testing

        Prior to returning to duty requiring the performance of safety
        sensitive functions when a driver has engaged in conduct
        prohibited under this policy/procedure, the driver shall undergo
        a return-to-duty alcohol and/or controlled substances test(s) as
        appropriate.

        Drivers found to have engaged in prohibited conduct under the
        alcohol provisions of this policy/procedure will not be
        permitted to return to duty unless the subsequent alcohol test
        reveals a result less than or consistent with federal and state
        standards. In cases involving controlled substances, a verified
        negative result is necessary before a driver may return to duty.

    F.  Follow-up Testing

        In the event that a driver has been found to have been in
        violation of the prohibitions herein contained and is identified
        as requiring assistance in resolving problems associated with
        alcohol and/or controlled substances, MSSM shall require the
        driver to submit to at least six (6) unannounced follow-up
        alcohol and/or controlled substances tests during the first
        twelve (12) months after returning to duty. Follow-up tests will
        be unannounced and may continue for up to sixty (60) months
        after returning to duty. Follow-up alcohol testing shall be
        conducted only when the driver is performing, just before, or
        just after ceasing to perform safety-sensitive functions.

VII. **REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO TESTING**

     All drivers who are required by federal regulations to submit to
     drug/alcohol testing must do so immediately upon being directed to
     submit to the test(s). A driver's refusal to submit to testing will
     subject the driver to immediate removal from the performance of
     safety-sensitive functions. In addition, failure to comply with
     Federal regulations or this procedure is grounds for disciplinary
     action up to and including dismissal. Any of the following actions
     on the part of a driver constitutes a refusal to submit to a test:

     A.  Failure to provide adequate specimens/samples of substance(s)
         undergoing testing, including but not limited to breath and
         urine, without a valid medical reason;

     B.  Refusing to empty his or her pockets;

     C.  Refusing to wash his/her hands after being directed to do so by
         the test collector;

     D.  Admitting to the collector that he/she adulterated or
         substituted his/her specimen;

     E.  Behaving in a confrontational way that disrupts the collection
         process;

     F.  Declines to allow a collection to be monitored or directly
         observed (as allowed federal regulations);

     G.  With respect to direct observation collections, the employee
         fails to follow the observer's instructions to raise or lower
         their clothing and to turn around to permit the observer to
         determine if the employee has a prosthetic or other device that
         could be used to interfere with the collection process; or the
         employee possesses or wears a prosthetic or other device that
         could be used to interfere with the collection process;

     H.  Refuses to void through self-catheterization if this is the
         employee's normal method.

     Refusal to cooperate in completion of required paperwork is
     recorded by the collector, but does not by itself constitute a
     refusal to test.

VIII. **TRAINING FOR SUPERVISORS**

      MSSM will assign persons who will be designated to determine
      whether reasonable suspicion exists to require a driver to undergo
      testing under Part 382, with at least sixty (60) minutes of
      training on alcohol misuse and receive at least an additional
      sixty (60) minutes of training on controlled substances. Training
      shall cover the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance
      indicators of probable alcohol misuse and use of controlled
      substances.

IX. **ENFORCEMENT**

    MSSM, in its independent authority as an employer, shall subject any
    driver who violates this policy/administrative procedure or Federal
    regulations to potential disciplinary action up to and including
    dismissal, except to the extent that any state law requires
    otherwise. In addition, any driver who refuses to submit to a
    post-accident, random, reasonable suspicion, return-to duty or
    follow-up test(s) shall not perform or continue to perform
    safety-sensitive functions.

    Furthermore, no driver tested and found to have an alcohol
    concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 shall perform or
    continue to perform safety-sensitive functions including driving a
    commercial motor vehicle until the start of the driver's next
    regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than twenty-four (24)
    hours after the test was administered.

X.  **RECORDS**

    Employee drug and alcohol tests and results shall be maintained
    under strict confidentiality in a secure location with controlled
    access and released only in accordance with law. A driver, upon
    written request, shall receive copies of any records pertaining to
    his/her use of drugs or alcohol, including any records pertaining to
    his/her drug tests. Records shall be made available to subsequent
    employers or other identified persons only when expressly requested
    in writing by the driver.

XI. **NOTIFICATIONS**

    Each driver shall receive educational materials prior to MSSM's
    commencement of alcohol and controlled substances testing. Such
    material will explain the requirements of the Code of Federal
    Regulations, Title 49 Part 382, and contain a copy of the Board's
    policy and administrative procedures for meeting these requirements.
    MSSM shall also include in the package of informational material
    submitted to each driver a statement certifying that he/she has
    received the informational material. MSSM shall maintain the
    original signed copy of the statement on file.

    In addition to the aforementioned items, MSSM shall also make
    available to drivers and representatives of employee organizations
    information which shall identify:

    A.  The person designated by MSSM to answer questions about the
        materials;

    B.  The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of
        alcohol and controlled substances; protect the driver and the
        integrity of the testing processes, safeguard the validity of
        the test results, and ensure that those results are attributed
        to the correct driver;

    C.  Information concerning the effects of alcohol and controlled
        substances on an individual's health, work, and personal life;
        signs and symptoms of an alcohol or a controlled substance(s)
        problem (the driver's or co-worker's); and available methods of
        intervening when an alcohol or controlled substances problem is
        suspected, including confrontation, referral to any employee
        assistance program and/or referral to management; and

    D.  Post-accident procedures that will make it possible for a driver
        to comply with post-accident testing before any driver operates
        a commercial vehicle. MSSM shall also make available the
        following information:

        A.  The results of pre-employment controlled substance test(s)
            if the applicant requests such results within sixty (60)
            calendar days of being notified of the disposition of the
            employment application; and

        B.  The results of random, reasonable suspicion and
            post-accident drug tests if the results are verified
            positive. MSSM shall also tell the driver which controlled
            substance(s) was verified as positive.

XII. **CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES**

     Drivers shall inform their supervisors if at any time they are
     using a controlled substance which their physician has prescribed
     for therapeutic purposes. Such substance may be used in conjunction
     with duty only if the physician has advised the driver that it will
     not adversely affect his/her ability to safely operate a commercial
     motor vehicle.

XIII. **REFERRAL, EVALUATION, AND TREATMENT**

      A.  Referral

          A driver who has engaged in conduct prohibited by this
          policy/procedure shall be advised by MSSM of resources
          available to the driver in evaluating and resolving problems
          associated with the misuse of alcohol and use of controlled
          substances. The information the bus driver receives will
          include: names, addresses, and telephone numbers of substance
          abuse professionals, counseling and treatment programs, in
          addition to information relating to his/her responsibility
          with regard to payment of such services.

      B.  Evaluation/Treatment

          A driver who engages in such prohibited conduct shall be
          evaluated by a substance abuse professional who shall
          determine what assistance or treatment, if any, the employee
          needs in resolving controlled substance(s) use.

XIV. **RETURN TO DUTY**

     If MSSM has not discharged a driver due to his/her engagement in
     prohibited conduct under this policy/procedure, the bus driver
     must, prior to returning to safety-sensitive duties:

     A.  Undergo return-to-duty testing and obtain an alcohol
         concentration level of less than 0.02 and/or a verified
         negative test for controlled substances;

     B.  Have been evaluated by a substance abuse professional; and

     C.  Have followed prescribed and/or recommended treatment.

XV. **OTHER POLICIES/PROCEDURES**

    Nothing contained in this administrative procedure shall prevent the
    Board from establishing and enforcing independent
    policies/procedures relating to the possession, being under the
    influence of, distribution, sale or use of alcohol or controlled
    substances or any misconduct associated therewith and the penalties
    for violation of those policies/procedures, up to and including
    dismissal.
