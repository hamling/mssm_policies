title: COMPREHENSIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN
---

The Board hereby adopts the Maine School of Science and Mathematics
Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. The Executive Director and
building administrators shall be responsible for developing, in
consultation with staff and persons or agencies with expertise in
planning for and responding to emergencies, a comprehensive emergency
management plan that identifies and addresses all hazards and potential
hazards that could reasonably be expected to affect the School and its
facilities.

The Executive Director and building administrators shall be responsible
for ensuring that the plan is implemented in the School and evaluated on
an annual basis and after each incident when the plan is used.

The following information pertaining to the MSSM Comprehensive Emergency
Management Plan is considered public information:

A.  A description of the scope and purpose of the Plan and the process
    used for developing and updating it;

B.  General information on auditing for safety and preparedness;

C.  Roles and responsibilities of School administrators, teachers, and
    staff and the designated chain of command during an emergency; and

D.  Strategies for conveying information to parents and the general
    public during an emergency. Except as specified in paragraphs A
    through D above, those portions of the Comprehensive Emergency
    Management Plan and any other records describing security plans,
    security procedures, or risk assessments prepared specifically for
    the purpose of preventing or preparing for acts of terrorism shall
    not be considered public information under the Freedom of Access Act
    but only to the extent that the release of such information could
    reasonably be expected to jeopardize the physical safety of School
    personnel or the public. For the purpose of this policy, "terrorism"
    is defined as in 1 M.R.S.A. ยง402(3)(L) as "conduct that is designed
    to cause serious bodily injury or substantial risk of bodily injury
    to multiple persons, substantial damage to multiple structures
    whether occupied or unoccupied, or substantial physical damage
    sufficient to disrupt the normal functioning of a critical
    infrastructure."
