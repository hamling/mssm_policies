code: EBCC
title: BOMB THREATS
---

The Maine School of Science and Mathematics Board of Trustees recognize
that bomb threats are a significant concern to our School. Whether real
and carried out or intended as a prank or for some other purpose, a bomb
threat represents a potential danger to the safety and welfare of
students, campers, and staff and to the integrity of School property.
Bomb threats disrupt the instructional program and learning environment
and also place significant demands on School financial resources and
public safety services. These effects occur even when such threats prove
to be false.

Any bomb threat will be regarded as an extremely serious matter and
treated accordingly. The Board directs the Executive Director to react
promptly and appropriately to information concerning bomb threats and to
initiate or recommend suitable disciplinary action.

A.  Conduct Prohibited

    No person shall make, or communicate by any means, whether verbal or
    non-verbal, a threat that a bomb has been, or will be, placed on
    School premises. Because of the potential for evacuation of the
    School and other disruption of School operations, placement of a
    bomb or of a "look-alike" bomb on School premises will be considered
    a threat for the purpose of this policy.

B.  It is also a violation of Board policy to communicate by any means
    that any toxic or hazardous substance or material has been placed,
    or will be placed, on School premises with the intent to endanger
    the safety and welfare of students or staff and/or to disrupt the
    operations of the School. For the purpose of this policy, "toxic or
    hazardous substance or material" means any material or substance,
    including biomedical materials or organisms, that, when placed as
    threatened, could be harmful to humans.

C.  Definitions

    1.  A "bomb" means an explosive, incendiary or poison gas bomb,
        grenade, rocket, missile, mine, "Molotov cocktail," or other
        destructive device.

    2.  A "look-alike bomb" means any apparatus or object that conveys
        the appearance of a bomb or other destructive device.

    3.  A "bomb threat" is the communication, by any means, whether
        verbal or non-verbal, that a bomb has been, or will be, placed
        on School premises, including possession or placement of a bomb
        or look-alike bomb on School premises.

    4.  "School premises" means any School property and any location
        where any School activities may take place.

D.  Development of Bomb Threat Procedures

    The Executive Director/designee shall be responsible for developing
    and implementing procedures specific to bomb threats as part of
    MSSM's Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan. These procedures are
    intended to inform administrators and staff of appropriate protocols
    to follow in the event that a bomb threat is received and should
    include provisions to address:

    1.  Threat assessment (for the purpose of identifying a response
        that is in proportion to the threat, in light of what is
        necessary to ensure safety);

    2.  Building evacuation and re-entry (including selection of
        potential alternative sites for those who are evacuated);

    3.  Incident "command and control" (who is in charge, and when);

    4.  Communications contacts and mandatory bomb threat reporting;

    5.  Parent notification process;

    6.  Training for staff members; and

    7.  Support services for students and staff. The Executive
        Director/designee will be responsible for overseeing a review or
        evaluation of bomb threat procedures annually.

E.  Reporting of Bomb Threats

    A student who learns of a bomb threat or the existence of a bomb on
    School premises must immediately report such information to the
    Executive Director, Dean of Students, teacher, or other employee.

    An employee of MSSM who learns of a bomb threat shall immediately
    inform an administrator. The administrator shall immediately take
    appropriate steps to protect the safety of students and staff in
    accordance with MSSM's bomb threat procedure, as developed under
    Section D, and inform the Executive Director of the threat.

    **All bomb threats shall be reported immediately to the local law
    enforcement authority, as provided in the bomb threat procedures.**

    The Executive Director shall be responsible for reporting any bomb
    threat to the Department of Education within two business days of
    the incident. Reports will include the name of the School, the date
    and time of the threat, the medium used to communicate the threat,
    and whether or not the perpetrators have been apprehended.

F.  Student Disciplinary Consequences

    Making a bomb threat is a crime under Maine law. Any student
    suspected of making a bomb threat shall be reported to law
    enforcement authorities for investigation and possible prosecution.
    Apart from any penalty imposed by law, and without regard to the
    existence or status of criminal charges, a student who makes a bomb
    threat shall be subject to disciplinary action by the School. The
    administration may suspend and/or recommend for expulsion any
    student who makes a bomb threat. The making of a bomb threat will be
    considered deliberately disobedient and deliberately disorderly
    within the meaning of 20-A M.R.S.A. §1001(9) and will be grounds for
    expulsion if found necessary for the peace and usefulness of the
    School.

    In addition, a student who is found after hearing to have brought a
    bomb to School shall be expelled from School for at least one year
    in accordance with 20-A M.R.S.A. §1001(9-A) and Policy JICIA, except
    that the Executive Director may modify the requirement for expulsion
    based on individual circumstances.

    A student who has been identified through the IEP process as having
    a disability and whose conduct in violation of this policy is
    related to the disability shall be disciplined as provided in
    paragraph one of Policy JKF- Disciplinary Removal of Students with
    Disabilities.

G.  Aiding Other Students in Making Bomb Threats

    A student who knowingly encourages, causes, aids, abets, or assists
    another student in making or communicating a bomb threat shall be
    subject to the disciplinary consequences described in Section F of
    this policy.

H.  Failure to Report a Bomb Threat

    A student who fails to report information or knowledge of a bomb
    threat or the existence of a bomb or other destructive device in a
    School building or on School property may be subject to disciplinary
    consequences, which may include suspension and/or expulsion.

I.  Staff Disciplinary Consequences

    Any MSSM employee who makes or communicates a bomb threat will be
    reported to appropriate law enforcement authorities and will be
    subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of
    employment. Disciplinary action taken shall be consistent employment
    agreements and Board policies.

    Any MSSM employee who fails to report information or knowledge of a
    bomb threat or the existence of a bomb on School premises will be
    subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.

J.  Civil Liability

    MSSM reserves the right to bring suit against any individual
    responsible for a violation of this policy and to seek restitution
    and other damages as permitted by law.

K.  Lost Instructional Time

    Instructional time lost as a result of a bomb threat will be
    rescheduled at the earliest appropriate or practicable opportunity,
    as determined by the Executive Director. Time lost may be
    rescheduled on a weekend or vacation day, or after what would
    normally be the last day of the school year.

L.  Notification Through Student Handbook

    All student handbooks shall address MSSM's bomb threat policy and
    procedures and explain the educational consequences of bomb threats.
    In addition, student handbooks shall notify students and parents
    that bomb threats violate Board policy and civil and criminal law.
