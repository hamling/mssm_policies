title: STORM DAY COMPENSATION
---

The Executive Director/designee may elect to partially close the school
in the event that the weather is sufficiently bad as to endanger
employees while they travel to and from home.

Employees will be compensated according to that day's schedule. Hours
paid on storm days will not count toward overtime.
