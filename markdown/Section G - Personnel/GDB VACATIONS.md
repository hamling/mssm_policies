title: VACATIONS
---

Full time, full year employees with at least six (6) months of
continuous service by July 1 shall be entitled to paid vacation during
the following twelve (12) months according to the accrual schedule
below. Vacation leave shall be taken at such times as approved by the
employee's direct supervisor. Vacation time may not be accumulated or
carried forward from one year to the next except as specifically
authorized by the Executive Director in writing and no more than 20 days
may be carried over. Part-time full year employees shall receive paid
vacation on a pro-rated basis. Full and part-time instructors and other
employees working on a school year contract or who are specifically
hired for the purposes of summer camp are not eligible for the vacation
benefits outlined herein. School year employees work on the basis of a
School calendar plus preparation days, unless specified in a separate
contract. Vacation eligibility shall be stated in the individual
employee contracts.

## Vacation Eligibility

For the purpose of this policy only, full-time employees shall be
defined as those scheduled for 35 hours per week, or more. The vacation
accrual shall be determined by the employee's primary job function --
e.g. an administrator who teaches a course as adjunct faculty or on a
voluntary basis shall have her/his vacation determined by her/his
administrative position.

## Exempt & Non-exempt Status

Employees are either on a salaried or hourly basis in accordance with
the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Employees that are exempt from
overtime regulations ("exempt employees") are paid on a salaried basis;
those who are non-exempt are paid on an hourly or salaried basis and are
subject to FLSA overtime provisions. All non-exempt employees that are
in a position scheduled to work less than forty (40) hours a week and/or
less than 12 months a year will be paid on an hourly basis.

## Administrative Employees

Administrative Employees are defined, for the purpose of this policy as:

-   Executive Director
-   Dean of Students/Residential Life
-   Dean of Enrollment Management
-   Chief Operating Officer
-   Academic Dean
-   Director of Facilities
-   Director of Summer Programs
-   Director of Information Technology
-   Assistant Director of Residential Life

## Vacation Accrual

Vacation is accrued on a fiscal year basis (July 1 through June 30).
Employees must be employed six (6) months before requesting vacation.
Employees who begin employment after the start of the fiscal year will
have vacation time computed on a pro-rated basis. The rate at which
vacation will accrue is determined by the employee's length of service
completed on the beginning of each fiscal year. Following is the
schedule for accruing vacation:

A.  Full-Time Employees

      -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      *Duration of Employment*    *Vacation Eligibility*    *Rate of Accrual*
      --------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------
      0-5                         10 days = 80 hours pay    .8333 days/month

      10-15                       15 days = 120 hours pay   1.25 days/month

      15+                         20 days = 160 hours pay   1.667 days/month
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*Accrual rate changes at the employee's fifth and fifteenth
anniversaries.

B.  Part-Time Employees Vacation hours will be pro-rated according to
    the above chart by the percentage of hours worked per pay period
    and/or days worked per year.

C.  The Executive Director may, when hiring, negotiate credited service
    in the initial contract for prior experience.

D.  Administrative Employees Administrators whose contracts are for
    twelve months accrue twenty days per year. The monthly rate of
    accrual is 1.667 days. Administrators whose contracts are for less
    than full-time and/or less than twelve months will receive the above
    accrual on a pro-rated basis.

## Vacation Approval

Vacation leave may be granted after the start of the fiscal year
following the start of employment. Employees are expected to request
vacation at least two weeks in advance. It is in the best interest of
the staff and the School that vacation be taken each fiscal year, July 1
through June 30. Compensation shall not be paid in lieu of vacation.

Holidays observed by the School, which fall during a scheduled vacation,
are not counted as vacation days. They are paid separately as a paid
holiday.

Vacation is paid at an employee's base pay rate at the time of the
absence and will not include any special forms of compensation such as
incentives, commissions, bonuses, or shift differentials. Vacation is
not counted as hours worked for the payment of overtime.

## Termination of Employment

Employees are eligible to receive payment for unused, accrued vacation
at the time of termination. Review by the Chief Operating Officer or
Executive Director is required prior to payment of any accrued vacation
at the time of termination.

## Implementation

This policy represents a major change in vacation accrual and use.
Employees who have signed their initial contracts prior to July 1, 2014
shall maintain their current privilege of "front loading" their vacation
(that is, to use their vacation before being accrued). All employees
signing an initial contract on or after July 1, 2014 shall operate under
the new policy.
