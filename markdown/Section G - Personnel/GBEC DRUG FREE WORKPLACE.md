title: DRUG FREE WORKPLACE
---

The MSSM Board of Trustees recognizes that alcoholism and drug
dependency are treatable diseases. Left untreated, they may result in
serious personal and family problems. At the same time, the Board of
Trustees is also seriously concerned about the effects of alcohol and
drug dependency upon an employee's job performance and ability to serve
as a role model for our students.

The Board of Trustees believes strongly that all employees and students
should be able to work and learn in an environment free from alcohol and
drug abuse. Accordingly, the Board of Trustees expects all employees to
report for work and to perform their duties in a manner that does not
jeopardize the health, safety, and well-being of co-workers and
students.

No employee shall distribute, dispense, possess, use, or be under the
influence of any alcoholic beverage, malt beverage, or fortified wine or
other intoxicating liquor. Nor shall an employee unlawfully manufacture,
distribute, dispense, possess, use, or be under the influence of any
narcotic drug, hallucinogenic drug, amphetamine, barbiturate, marijuana,
anabolic steroid, or any other controlled substance (as defined in
Schedules I through V of section 202 of the Federal Controlled Substance
Act \[21 USC §812\]; by regulation at 21 CFR, §1300.11 through 1300.15;
and in 17-A MRSA, §1101). This applies before, during, and after school
hours, at School, or in any other School location, defined as follows:
"School location" means in any School building or on any School
premises; in any School-owned vehicle or in any other School-approved
vehicle used to transport students to and from School or School
activities; off School property at any School-sponsored or
School-approved activity, event or function, such as a field trip or
athletic event, where students are under the jurisdiction of the School;
or during any period of time such employee is supervising students on
behalf of the School or otherwise engaged in School business.

Any employee who suspects that he/she may have an alcohol or drug
dependency problem is strongly encouraged to contact his/her supervisor
to seek voluntary diagnosis and treatment. The employee will be provided
confidential referral services to an outside agency upon request and
assisted in determining the extent to which insurance coverage to help
pay for such services is available. All voluntary referrals shall be
kept confidential.

Any illegal use, possession, furnishing, selling, or provision of
assistance in obtaining alcoholic beverages or scheduled drugs not
covered by the preceding paragraph may, depending upon the
circumstances, constitute sufficient grounds for discipline, up to and
including dismissal. Referrals under foregoing paragraphs of this policy
will not preclude disciplinary action under this paragraph, depending on
the circumstances.

As provided in the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, any employee is
required to notify the School of a criminal or civil conviction for a
drug violation occurring in the workplace no later than five calendar
days after such conviction. In turn, the Executive Director, within 10
calendar days of learning of such a conviction, is to give written
notification to the U.S. Department of Education and to any other
federal agency from which the School receives grant funds.

Appropriate disciplinary sanctions shall be taken against any employee
who violates the terms of this drug and alcohol policy, up to and
including dismissal.

## Implementation

The Executive Director shall be responsible for developing and
administering appropriate procedures to implement this policy.

## Communication

A copy of this policy is to be given or mailed to all current employees
and to new employees at the time of their employment and is to be posted
in appropriate locations throughout the School.
