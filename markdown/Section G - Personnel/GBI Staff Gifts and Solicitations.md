Employees of the Maine School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM) may not
accept any monetary gifts (for example: cash, checks, debit cards, gift
cards, gift certificates, or any negotiable instrument) from parents,
board members, students, suppliers, vendors, etc., in any amount
whatsoever. In the event that a monetary gift is offered, the employee
should refer the donor to the MSSM Foundation, Inc.

It is against MSSM policy for an employee to accept gifts from any
person or business that conducts business, or expects to conduct
business, with MSSM.

Further, it is unlawful for School staff to accept gifts that are
intended to improperly influence the School staff in the exercise of
their duties.

Employees may accept promotional merchandise/items of nominal value
(less than \$25) such as calendars, pens, or pencils, mugs, magnets,
etc.

The Executive Director may authorize appropriate staff appreciation
events.
