## Compensation

Holiday pay for staff members is one day of pay at the employee's normal
rate. Full-time year-long employees are entitled to take a day off with
holiday pay on a designated holiday. Part-time non-instructional
employees are entitled to the day off with holiday pay prorated the
percentage of time worked. Those hourly employees working the holiday
will be entitled to holiday pay plus earnings for the hours worked. If a
recognized holiday falls during an eligible staff member's paid absence
(such as vacation or sick leave), holiday pay will be paid in lieu of
the vacation or sick hours that would have otherwise applied.

academic calendar and are not entitled to the day off with or without
pay if school is in session.

Adjustments will be made by the Executive Director for holidays falling
on weekends.

Direct supervisor will set schedules for coverage on holidays and will
notify employees who are scheduled to work. The Executive Director shall
have authority to adjust the schedule when making the annual school
calendar.
