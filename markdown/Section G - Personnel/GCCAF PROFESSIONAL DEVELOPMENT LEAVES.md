title: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT LEAVES
---

**DEFINITIONS** For purposes of this policy:

1.  Sabbatical Leave shall be defined as a leave where the employee is
    absent from work while the employee pursues professional
    development.

2.  Professional Development Leave shall be a leave where the employee
    is expected to work part-time and spend the remainder of the time in
    professional development pursuits.

## SABBATICAL LEAVE

Sabbatical leave may be granted to an employee for study related to
her/his field, or for travel related to her/his field, or for other
reasons of value to the School. All leave requests are subject to the
approval of the Board and subject to the following conditions:

A.  Sabbatical leave shall be granted to a maximum of two (2) employees
    at any one time.

B.  Notice of intent to apply for sabbatical leave must be received by
    the Executive Director in writing no later than December 15th of the
    School year preceding the year of such leave. The employee must
    submit the application no later than February 1 and shall also
    complete said School year. Action shall be taken by the Board on all
    such requests no later than April 1 of the School year prior to the
    School year for which the sabbatical leave is requested. The
    Executive Director shall meet with the sabbatical leave applicant
    prior to making recommendation to the Board for approval. The
    purpose of this meeting is to review the application prior to the
    submission of said application to the Board.

C.  The employee requesting sabbatical leave has completed at least
    five (5) consecutive full-time school years of service in the School
    since hiring or since her/his last prior sabbatical leave, if any.

D.  Within ten (10) days from the Board's decision, written notification
    of such decision shall be sent to the applicant. Reasons shall be
    provided to the applicant in writing if the sabbatical leave request
    is denied.

E.  An employee on sabbatical leave shall be paid by the Board at fifty
    percent (50%) of the wage or salary rate which she/he would have
    received if she/he had remained actively employed by the Board.

F.  Health Insurance will continue to be paid during the period of leave
    at the rate that would have been paid if the employee had remained
    actively employed by the Board. This does not preclude the
    possibility of the employee requesting a different plan, but
    compensation will not exceed what was applied for when sabbatical
    was originally requested.

G.  Upon return from sabbatical leave, an employee shall be placed on
    the salary schedule at the level which she/he would have attained
    had she/he remained actively employed in the School during the
    period of her/his absence.

H.  Before receiving sabbatical leave under the provision of this
    policy, the employee shall agree in writing with the Board that
    she/he will return to the School for a period of not less than
    two (2) years for a full time sabbatical and not less than one (1)
    year for a half time sabbatical, and also that, in the event of
    breach of such agreement, she/he will repay the Board all sums
    advanced for her/his Sabbatical leave, in proportion to the
    fulfillment of her/his two (2) year reemployment commitment. The
    teacher shall be released from such payment if his/her failure to
    serve the time as stipulated is due to illness, disability, death,
    or if he/she is discharged (unless discharged for cause) from
    his/her position by the Board or Executive Director.

## Professional Development Leave

A.  Professional development leave without pay for a maximum of two (2)
    years may be granted to any non-probationary employee who joins
    Peace Corps, VISTA, National Educators Corps, or who serves as an
    exchange educator or overseas educator, or who accepts and
    participates in a Fulbright Scholarship, or pursues other
    professional development opportunities. Leaves granted under this
    Section shall count as time in service up to a maximum of two (2)
    years for purposes of applications for sabbatical leave.

B.  A leave of absence without pay shall be granted to any employee for
    military service.

C.  The Board may grant any employee a leave of absence without pay and
    without forfeiture of other accumulated benefits to fulfill the
    duties of a State Legislator provided written notice of intent to
    become a candidate for the Legislature is given to the Executive
    Director by March 1^st^ preceding the election.

D.  All requests for leaves, extensions, and renewals thereof shall be
    applied for in writing to the Executive Director no later than
    December 15th of the School year preceding the year of such leave.
    The employee must submit the application no later than February 1
    and shall also complete said School year. All requests shall be
    answered in writing by April 1^st^ of said School year. Reasons
    shall be provided to the applicant in writing if the professional
    development leave request is denied.

E.  All individuals granted leave shall notify the Executive Director of
    their intent to return no later than six months preceding their
    return (unless waived by the Executive Director.)

F.  An employee will not accrue additional benefits while on
    professional development leave and may elect to continue his/her
    insurance plans by paying the full cost of the premiums.
