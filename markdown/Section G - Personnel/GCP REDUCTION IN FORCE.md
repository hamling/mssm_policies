title: REDUCTION IN FORCE
---

A.  **Purpose**

    A reduction in force (or layoff) is an action to reduce the number
    of employees at the School, overall. A layoff may become necessary
    due to reduced funding, reorganization, changed workload, or the
    cancellation, amendment, or completion of a grant or contract.

    It is the policy of the School that employees are to be laid off
    only after examining all other available alternatives; including
    separation of temporary employees, delay in the filling of vacant
    positions, position re-design, or re-organization. When facing the
    layoff of an employee, MSSM is obligated to make every effort to
    place that employee prior to the effective date of layoff.
    Responsibility for the decision as to which employee(s) must be
    separated is with the Executive Director.

    To avoid delays in processing, the Director of Human Resources shall
    be notified in a timely manner prior to the anticipated separation
    of an affected employee by layoff.

    The last day the employee works is the effective date of a layoff.
    An employee separated by layoff is paid for accumulated vacation
    leave in the same manner as other separations. In addition, the
    employee may be eligible for other benefits as described in this
    policy.

B.  **Eligibility**

    This policy applies to permanent MSSM employees who have completed
    their probationary periods (full-time and part-time regularly
    scheduled to work 20 or more hours each work week) and to employees
    in probationary periods who have completed at least six months of
    their contract.

    Temporary employees, employees with time-limited appointments,
    permanent employees scheduled less than 20 hours per week, and
    probationary employees who have completed less than six months of
    their contact may be separated without following this policy and are
    not eligible for re-employment preference.

C.  **Identifying Employees for Layoff**

    A layoff decision requires a thorough evaluation of the need for
    specific positions and the relative qualifications of employees so
    the School can provide the highest level of service possible with a
    smaller work force.

    Normally, the level at which this review should occur is the School
    as a whole.

    When identifying employees for layoff, administration must consider
    the following factors:

    1.  the position classification(s) affected,

    2.  the appointment type of each employee,

    3.  the relative performance of employees in affected
        classification(s),

    4.  length of total service

    The source of funds is not a relevant factor in determining the
    appropriate employee to be laid off. For example, if the position is
    grant-funded and the grant is ending, it does not necessarily mean
    that the incumbent of the grant-fundedposition should be the
    employee laid off. The overall performance rating must be applied,
    without regard to funding source.

    *Position Classification*: For the purpose of determining which
    employee(s) will be affected by a layoff, comparisons will be made
    between employees with the same or closely related classification
    titles. A position classification title is closely related to the
    targeted position if there is a reasonable skills transfer.

    *Type of Appointment*: Once the relevant jobs for the layoff have
    been determined, the Executive Director shall make a decision as to
    which employee(s) are designated for layoff. The factor which shall
    be considered first is type of appointment. Permanent employees must
    be retained over employees with temporary, probationary, and
    time-limited appointments.

    *Relative Performance*: The primary component of determining the
    relative performance of employees shall be the most recent annual
    overall performance rating. Other components of determining relative
    performance are:

    1.  The existence of an active disciplinary action for either job
        performance or personal conduct;

    2.  The presence of performance-related prizes, awards, or
        commendations awarded on a School basis;

    3.  Documented performance difficulties communicated to the
        employee, but not rising to the level of disciplinary action;

    4.  Any other documented indicator of performance.

    The Executive Director is responsible for making the layoff decision
    using all of the above factors. It is policy that relative
    performance be accorded the most weight in making this decision.

    *Length of Service*: Length of total service may become a
    differentiating factor in the decision to separate an employee,
    particularly where other criteria are substantially equivalent.

D.  **Requesting Layoff Approval**

    The Executive Director should notify the Director of Human Resources
    of the proposed layoff. The request should be reviewed by HR before
    any layoff action should be taken. The written request must contain
    the following information:

    1.  The reason(s) for the layoff

    2.  Anticipated date of separation,

    3.  Name(s) of the employee(s) to be laid off and justification for
        the decision,

    4.  A listing of all vacant positions in the School which are the
        same or closely related,

    5.  Status of recruitment activity for vacant positions which are
        the same or closely related,

    6.  What efforts were made to avoid the layoff of the selected
        employee,

    7.  A brief explanation why action other than layoff is not
        possible.

E.  **Notifying Employees to Be Laid Off**

    After notifying Human Resources, the HR department must provide the
    following information, in writing, to the employee(s) being laid off
    at least 30 calendar days or in accordance with the employment
    contract before a layoff occurs:

    1.  The reason for the layoff (e.g., reduced funding,
        reorganization, changed workload, or the cancellation,
        amendment, or completion of a grant or contract);

    2.  The effective date of the layoff (the employee must receive the
        notification at least 30 calendar days prior to the effective
        date);

    3.  Instructions to contact the Office of Human Resources to obtain
        necessary information on:

        a.  Retirement system membership and benefit continuation
            options, including unemployment insurance eligibility;
        b.  Completion of necessary forms;
        c.  The availability of aid in seeking other employment

F.  **Reduction in Hours for a Position**

    In the event that the Executive Director wishes to make a permanent
    reduction in hours for a currently fullÂ­-time permanent employee,
    there are two options: reduce the employee's hours or a complete
    layoff. However, the employee makes the choice.

    The HR department must present the employee (in writing and orally)
    with the choice of either a reduction in hours or a complete layoff.
    A permanent reduction in hours shall include a corresponding
    reduction in pay and a possible reduction in benefits

    The Executive Director shall provide the employee with a reasonable
    amount of time to consider the decision of a a reduction in hours or
    to be laid off.

    If the employee agrees to a reduction in hours, the HR department
    must draft a letter outlining the changes that are proposed. This
    shall include new salary or wage rate, new leave earnings, and the
    effect this reduction will have on the employee's benefits. The
    letter must be signed by the affected employee to show that all
    information was conveyed.

    The change in hours can be made effective immediately; there does
    not have to be a 30-day advance written notice to make this change
    if the employee has agreed to it.

    If the employee does not wish to accept a reduction in hours, with
    the accompanying changes to salary and benefits, then the employee
    shall be laid off according to the process outlined in this policy.

G.  **Priority Re-Employment Consideration**

    An employee who will be separated due to a layoff is eligible for
    priority re-employment consideration. Permanent employees who are
    separated by a layoff are eligible to receive preferred
    re-employment for a period of twelve months from the date they
    receive written notification of the layoff decision.

    When competing with external applicants who are not current
    employees, layoff candidates shall be selected for open positions,
    if qualified, as long as they are able to perform the essential
    functions of the position within a reasonable length of time,
    including normal orientation and training given to any new employee.
    The hiring department may select a current School employee over a
    layoff candidate if the current employee is better qualified.

    After the approval of a layoff request, the Office of Human
    Resources will contact the layoff candidate to schedule an
    information session. At the information session, HR will explain the
    layoff policies and benefits available to the employee.

    Through the monitoring of lists of priority candidates maintained by
    the Office of Human Resources, an employee will be considered for
    any available vacant position for which he/she qualifies and will be
    notified of all internal postings.

    Preferred status will end when an employee declines an interview or
    an employment offer for a position substantially equivalent to their
    previous position or which offers a higher rate of pay.

H.  **Abolishment of Position**

    When an employee is laid off due to lack of work or a loss of funds,
    it is expected that the School will abolish the employee's position.
