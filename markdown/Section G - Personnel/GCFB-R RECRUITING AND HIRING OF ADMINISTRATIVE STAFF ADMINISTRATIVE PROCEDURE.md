  PROCEDURE
---

These procedures implement policy GCFB and are designed to establish a
thorough, efficient, and nondiscriminatory practice for the recruiting
and hiring of the most qualified candidates for administrative
positions.

A.  Job Description Development/Review

    To ensure that a written role description of the vacant position
    accurately represents the current functions and needs, the Executive
    Director (the Board of Trustees in an Executive Director search) is
    to:

    1.  Conduct a review of (if none exists, develop) the job
        description, with input from persons affected by the position;

    2.  Include the criteria (skills, knowledge, abilities) required to
        perform the duties/responsibilities of the position; and

    3.  List the minimum qualifications (training, education, and
        experience) for the position.

B.  Recruitment

    To attract a strong pool of qualified candidates, the Executive
    Director or designee is to advertise (except in the circumstances
    described in K below) by:

    1.  Posting notice of the vacancy for a minimum of three days within
        the School;

    2.  Placing a display advertisement in appropriate print media,
        considering at least one appearance in a major Maine weekend or
        Sunday newspaper;

    3.  Posting notice of the vacancy in the Employment section of the
        School website; and

    4.  Identifying and notifying other possible sources of potential
        candidates, such as professional associations, educational
        administration programs, and placement offices at colleges and
        universities in Maine and other states.

C.  Screening

    To ensure that a fair and efficient screening process will occur,
    the Executive Director or designee is to:

    1.  Ensure that all applications are reviewed by more than one
        individual, with attention given to an unbiased regard for the
        criteria and qualifications in the job description;

    2.  Appoint a screening panel with representation as deemed
        appropriate to the particular vacancy;

    3.  Provide orientation on confidentiality and equity issues to
        screeners;

    4.  Eliminate all candidates who do not meet the minimum
        qualifications;

    5.  Conduct preliminary reference checks, as appropriate;

    6.  Select candidates for interview based on the degree to which
        they meet the criteria and demonstrate the skills, knowledge,
        and abilities outlined in the job description; and

    7.  Notify applicants not selected for interview.

D.  Interviewing

    To ensure that the interview process will be conducted in a legal
    and proper manner, the Executive Director is to:

    1.  Appoint an interview panel (may be the same persons who serve
        the screening function) with representation as deemed
        appropriate to the particular vacancy;

    2.  Provide orientation on the process including the function and
        extent of responsibility of the panel, the weighting of
        criteria, and the nomination/hiring procedure; and

    3.  Conduct training to ensure that panel members are aware of the
        legal aspects of interviewing, including confidentiality and
        equity issues.

    The interviewing panel is to:

    1.  Design interview questions which match the criteria and the
        duties/responsibilities outlined in the job description; and

    2.  Provide equal opportunity for the candidates to respond to the
        same questions/questioners.

E.  Selection

    The interview panel is to:

    1.  Individually assess the candidates according to their answers to
        the job description-related questions, rating and commenting on
        each using a specially prepared form corresponding to the
        questions/criteria; and considering the candidate's background
        and experience.

    2.  Submit a report to the Executive Director, including the
        individual rating forms as well as a list (usually 2 to 4) of
        candidates to be considered further for the position.

    The Executive Director is to:

    1.  Have reference contacts made, as appropriate, to check perceived
        strengths and weaknesses of the candidates;

    2.  Review the material on the finalist candidates to determine
        whether additional information is needed;

    3.  Conduct final interviews of any or all finalists, as deemed
        necessary;

    4.  Select the most qualified candidate who fits the criteria and
        the duties/responsibilities outlined in the job description,
        based on his/her own professional judgment along with those of
        the interview panel (or, reject all finalists, reopen the
        position and begin the process anew); and

    5.  Have any further reference checks made, as appropriate.

F.  Nomination/Employment

    The Executive Director is to:

    1.  Notify and obtain agreement of the successful candidate;

    2.  Inform the interview panel; and

    3.  Employ the successful candidate in accordance with state law and
        local policies.

G.  Notification

    The Executive Director will:

    1.  Notify the nominee and employ the administrator; and

    2.  Notify the other candidates interviewed.

H.  Orientation and Support

    To ensure that the new administrator is provided with the proper
    information about the system and job expectations, the Executive
    Director is to provide an orientation that includes expectations of
    the duties/responsibilities of the position along with the policies
    and procedures of the School.

I.  Record Keeping

    To ensure that the confidentiality of employee and applicant records
    are properly maintained, the Executive Director is to provide for
    the maintenance in secure files of all applications and
    documentation of the hiring, screening, and interviewing process for
    a period of three (3) years.

J.  Confidentiality

    To ensure that confidentiality is maintained throughout and
    permanently following the hiring process, the Board of Trustees, all
    employees involved, and any other participants are to maintain
    absolute confidentiality about candidates, including names, in
    accordance with state law (20-A MRSA § 6101). The Board of Trustees
    is to assume responsibility through the Executive Director for
    providing adequate orientation at appropriate stages of the process,
    including at the completion.

K.  Hiring of Current Employees

    The School may forego one or more of the steps set forth in sections
    B-E of this procedure and appoint a person who is currently employed
    by the School to fill an administrative position only if the
    Executive Director, or the Board of Trustees in an Executive
    Director search, determines that the following circumstances exist:

    1.  The currently employed candidate is exceptionally well qualified
        for the position; and

    2.  The decision to forego all or part of the recruitment and
        screening process will not detract from the goals of this
        policy.
