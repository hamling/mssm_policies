title: ROOM AND BOARD WAIVER
---

The Maine School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM) recognizes that
employees want the finest education for their dependents. Therefore,
MSSM will provide full-time employees with a waiver for their dependents
to attend MSSM. Employees' dependents will have to apply and meet
eligibility requirements as any other applicant and reside in the
dormitory to qualify for the waiver.

MSSM will provide up to five (5) fee waivers annually for accepted
dependents of full-time MSSM faculty and staff. Should more than five
(5) dependents apply for this benefit in a single year; the fee waiver
will be prorated equally among the affected dependents. This benefit
shall not exceed the total of five (5) room and board expense
equivalents (e.g., Fiscal Year 2014 fees \$8,450 x 5 = \$42,250).
