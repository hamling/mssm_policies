title: SUPERVISION AND EVALUATION OF INSTRUCTORS
---

It is incumbent upon this Board of Trustees to ensure that sufficient
administrative time and energy are expended to supervise (observe and
assist) and evaluate (measure and assess) instructors. A well-planned
and systematic program of supervision and evaluation of instructor
performance is vital to the ongoing improvement of the instructional
program. The evaluation program shall address all aspects of teaching
performance and recognize that the fulfillment of student needs is of
primary importance.

This policy shall apply to full-time or adjunct instructors for each
course. This policy shall not apply to summer camp or other outreach
programs.

The Executive Director shall be responsible for development,
implementation, and periodic review of a comprehensive program of
supervision and evaluation. The program shall specify minimum standards
for the number and frequency of formal performance reviews, with the
understanding that probationary instructors require closer support and
more frequent performance reviews.

A.  Evaluative criteria shall be in written form and made permanently
    available to the instructor;

B.  Evaluations shall be made by an immediate supervisor or
    administrator;

C.  Results of the evaluations shall be in writing and shall be
    discussed with the instructor;

D.  The instructor being evaluated shall have the right to attach a
    memorandum to the written evaluation; and

E.  Results of all evaluations shall be kept in confidential personnel
    files maintained at the Executive Director's office.

In keeping with the Board of Trustees' goal of employing the best
qualified instructors to provide quality education for all students, all
instructors shall participate fully in the evaluation process,
self-appraisal, and continuous improvement of professional skills.

The Executive Director shall involve instructors in the development and
periodic review of the supervision and evaluation program.
