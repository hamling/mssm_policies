---

In response to An Act to Promote Equity of Opportunity for Women in
Administrative Positions in the Public School System (PL 1989, Chap.
889), the Board of Trustees affirms its commitment to the strict
prohibition of discrimination in employment on the basis of race,
national origin, religion, sex, age, or disability, and to the principle
of affirmative action to obtain wide and representative candidate pools.

In accordance with 20-A MRSA, §1001(13), the Executive Director shall
prepare a procedure designed to ensure nondiscriminatory practice in
recruitment and hiring for all positions, as well as to result in
selection of the most qualified candidates. This procedure shall be
attached hereto as GCFB-R, and shall be reviewed periodically.

Moreover, upon each occasion of administrative vacancy, the Executive
Director shall review the procedure and make appropriate adaptations as
may be warranted by special circumstances. In the case of a vacancy in
the Executive Director position, the Board of Trustees shall review the
procedure, adapting as appropriate.
