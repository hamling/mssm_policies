All concussions and other head injuries are potentially serious and may
result in complications including prolonged brain damage and death if
not recognized and managed properly. They are caused by a bump, blow, or
jolt to the head, or by a blow to another part of the body with the
force transmitted to the head. They can range from mild to severe and
can disrupt the way the brain normally works. Even a "ding" or a bump on
the head can be serious. You cannot see a concussion and most
concussions occur without loss of consciousness. Signs and symptoms of
concussion may show up right after the injury or can take hours or days
to fully appear. If your student reports any symptoms of concussion, or
if you notice the symptoms or signs of concussion yourself, seek medical
attention right away.

Symptoms may include one or more of the following:

-   Headaches
-   "Don't feel right"
-   "Pressure in head"
-   Fatigue or low energy
-   Nausea or repeated vomiting\*
-   Sadness
-   Neck pain
-   Nervousness or anxiety
-   Balance problems or dizziness
-   Irritability
-   Blurred, double, or fuzzy vision
-   Feeling more emotional
-   Sensitivity to light or noise
-   Confusion
-   Feeling sluggish or slowed down
-   Concentration or memory problems
-   Feeling foggy or groggy (e.g., forgetting game plays)
-   Drowsiness
-   Repeating the same question/comment
-   Change in sleep patterns
-   Amnesia

Signs that may be observed by teammates, fellow students, parents, or
activity supervisors include:

-   Appears dazed
-   Vacant facial expression
-   Pained facial expression
-   Cannot recall events prior to hit
-   Confused about assignment
-   Cannot recall events after hit
-   Forgets plays
-   Seizures or convulsions\*
-   Black/blue behind eyes/ears\*
-   Is unsure of game, score, or opponent
-   Any change in typical behavior or personality
-   Moves clumsily or displays a lack of coordination - Loses
    consciousness\*
-   Answers questions slowly - Slurred speech\*

\*Symptom warrants an immediate trip to the closest emergency room

## What can happen if my student keeps on participating in an activity with a concussion or returns too soon?

Students with the signs and/or symptoms of concussion shall be removed
from participation immediately. Continuing to participate with the signs
and symptoms of concussion leaves students especially vulnerable to
greater injury. There is an increased risk of significant damage from a
concussion for a period of time after that concussion occurs,
particularly if the student suffers another concussion before completely
recovering from the first one. This can lead to prolonged recovery, or
even to severe brain swelling (Second Impact Syndrome) with devastating
and even fatal consequences. It is well known that adolescents and
teenagers will often under-report symptoms of injuries, and concussions
are no different. As a result, education of administrators, coaches,
staff, parents, and students is the key to student safety.

## If you think your student has suffered a concussion

Any student suspected of suffering a concussion shall be removed from
the game, practice, or activity immediately. No student may return to an
activity after an apparent head injury or concussion, regardless of how
mild it seems or how quickly symptoms clear, without medical clearance.
Close observation of the student should continue for several hours.
