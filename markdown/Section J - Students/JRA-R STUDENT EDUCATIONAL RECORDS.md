## ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE

I.  This administrative procedure is intended to assist administrators
    and School staff in complying with the requirements of federal and
    state statutes and regulations concerning student education records
    and information, including special education requirements.

II. **DEFINITIONS**

    The following definitions apply to terms used in this policy:

    A.  "Act" means the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20
        USC ยง 1232g).

    B.  "Directory information" means the following information
        contained in an education record of a student: name,
        participation and grade level of students in officially
        recognized activities and sports, height and weight of student
        athletes, grade level in School of participants in
        extracurricular activities, dates of attendance at MSSM, honors
        and awards received, and photographs and videos relating to
        School attendance and participation in School activities (except
        photographs and videos on the Internet).

    C.  "Eligible student" means a student who has attained eighteen
        years of age who has not been judged by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be so severely impaired that the student is
        unable to make decisions or exercise judgment on his/her own
        behalf. When a student attains the age of eighteen, all rights
        accorded to parents concerning education records transfer to the
        eligible student. Students, regardless of age, who have been
        emancipated by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be
        deemed "eligible."

    D.  "Parent" means parent, regardless of divorce or separation, a
        legal guardian, or individual acting as a parent or guardian
        provided that there shall be a presumption that a parent has the
        authority to exercise the rights inherent in the Act, unless
        there is evidence of a state law or court order governing such
        matters as divorce, separation or custody, or a legally binding
        instrument that specifically revokes such rights.

    E.  "Education Record" means any information or data that directly
        relates to a student and is maintained by MSSM in any medium,
        including but not limited to, handwriting, print, computer
        media, video or audio tape, microfilm and microfiche. Records of
        instructional, supervisory and administrative personnel and
        personnel who support these individuals, which are in the sole
        possession of the maker thereof and which are not accessible or
        revealed to any other person except a temporary substitute for
        the person who made the record are excluded from this
        definition.

    F.  "School" means MSSM.

    G.  "Student" includes any individual with respect to whom MSSM
        maintains education records.

    H.  "Superintendent" shall refer to the senior executive officer of
        MSSM regardless of the actual title held

III. **ANNUAL NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS**

     Parents and eligible students shall be provided with notice of
     their rights under FERPA and other applicable federal and state
     laws and regulations concerning education records at the beginning
     of each School year or upon enrollment if a student enrolls after
     the start of the School year. MSSM may provide notice through any
     of the following means:

     A.  Mailings to students' homes;

     B.  Publication in student handbooks;

     C.  Publication in newsletters or other materials distributed to
         each parent/eligible student.

IV. **ACCESS TO POLICY AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES**

    MSSM's policy on Student Education Records and Information shall be
    available in each building and the MSSM website. In addition, School
    administrators shall provide copies of this administrative procedure
    to parents/eligible students upon request.

V.  **INSPECTION AND REVIEW OF EDUCATION RECORDS**

    Parents/eligible students may review and inspect their educational
    records by the following procedure:

    A.  The parent/eligible student must make a written request to the
        Superintendent to review the records.

    B.  The Superintendent will comply with the request without
        unnecessary delay and in a reasonable period of time, but in no
        case more than 45 days after it received the request, and will
        comply before any IEP Team meeting regarding an Individualized
        Education Program or any due process hearing relating to the
        identification, evaluation, or placement of the student.

    C.  The Superintendent may deny a request for access to or copies of
        the student's education records if there is a reasonable doubt
        as to the legality of the parent-child relationship. Access will
        be withheld until a determination of legal right to access can
        be established.

    Parents/eligible students may also request to review the following:

    A.  MSSM's list of types and locations of all records and titles of
        officials responsible for the records.

    B.  MSSM's record of disclosures of personally identifiable
        information (see following section).

VI. **REQUESTS TO AMEND EDUCATION RECORDS**

    Parents/eligible students may ask MSSM to amend education records
    they believe are inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the
    student's privacy rights as follows:

    A.  The parent/eligible student must make a written request to the
        Superintendent to amend the education record. The request must
        clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and
        specify why it is inaccurate or misleading.

    B.  The Superintendent shall, within a reasonable period of time
        after the receipt of the request, either amend the record in
        accordance with the request or inform the parent/eligible
        student of its refusal to amend the record and inform the
        parent/eligible student of their right to request a hearing.

    C.  If the parent/eligible student requests a hearing, it shall be
        held within a reasonable period of time from MSSM's receipt of
        the written request. The parent/eligible student shall be given
        advance notice of the date, place, and time of the hearing. The
        Superintendent shall designate an individual to conduct the
        hearing. This individual may be an employee of MSSM so long as
        he/she does not have a direct interest in the outcome of the
        hearing. The parent/eligible student shall be afforded a full
        and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the issues
        raised and may be assisted or represented by individuals of
        his/her choice at his/her own expense, including an attorney.

    D.  MSSM shall make its decision in writing within a reasonable
        period of time. The decision of the School shall include a
        summary of the evidence and the reasons for the decision.

    E.  If, as a result of the hearing, MSSM decides that the
        information is inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation
        of the privacy rights of the student, it shall amend the
        education records of the student accordingly and so inform the
        parent/eligible student in writing.

    F.  If, as a result of the hearing, MSSM decides that the
        information is not inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in
        violation of the privacy rights of the student, it shall inform
        the parent/eligible student of their right to include a
        statement in the student's education record about the contested
        information and/or setting forth any reasons for disagreeing
        with the decision of MSSM.

    G.  Any statement placed in the student's education record under the
        preceding paragraph shall be maintained as long as the record or
        contested portion is maintained by MSSM. If the education record
        of the student or the contested portion is disclosed by MSSM to
        any party, the explanation shall also be disclosed.

VII. **DISCLOSURE OF EDUCATION RECORDS**

     All disclosures of education records will be made in compliance
     with federal and state statutes and regulations. MSSM will maintain
     a record of disclosures of personally identifiable information from
     the education records of a student. Such records do not include
     disclosures to the parent/eligible student, disclosures made
     pursuant to written consent of the parent/eligible student,
     disclosures to School officials or any disclosures of directory
     information. MSSM will not disclose any personally identifiable
     information from the education records of a student without the
     prior written consent of the parent/eligible student. The written
     consent shall include a specification of the records which may be
     disclosed, the purpose(s) of the disclosure(s), and the identity of
     the party or parties to whom the disclosure(s) may be made.

     There are several exceptions to the requirement to obtain prior
     written consent before disclosing education records as follows:

     A.  **Directory Information**. MSSM may make directory information
         (as described in the Definitions section) public at its
         discretion unless a parent/eligible student has notified the
         Superintendent in writing by September 15th or within
         thirty (30) days of enrollment, whichever is later.

         MSSM may disclose directory information about former students
         without the consent of the parent/eligible student.

     B.  **Military Recruiters/Institutions of Higher Education**.
         Military recruiters and institutions of higher education are
         entitled to receive the names, addresses and telephone numbers
         of secondary students, and MSSM must comply with any such
         request, provided that parents have been notified of their
         right to request that this information not be released without
         their prior written consent. Parents/eligible students who do
         not want MSSM to disclose this information must notify the
         Superintendent in writing by September 15th or within
         thirty (30) days of enrollment, whichever is later.

     C.  **School Officials with Legitimate Educational Interests**.
         Education records may be disclosed to School officials with a
         "legitimate educational interest." A School official has a
         legitimate educational interest if he/she needs to review an
         education record in order to fulfill his/her professional
         responsibility. School officials include person employed by
         MSSM as an administrator, supervisor, instructor or support
         staff member (including health or medical staff and MSSM's
         designated law enforcement personnel, if any); members of the
         Board of Education; persons or companies with whom MSSM has
         contracted to provides specific services (such as attorneys,
         auditors, medical consultants, evaluators or therapists); and
         parents, students or volunteers serving on an official
         committee (such as a disciplinary or grievance committee) or
         assisting a School official in performing his/her professional
         responsibilities.

     D.  **Other Schools**. Under Maine law (20-A M.R.S.A. ยง 6001-B),
         MSSM is required to send a student's education records to a
         School to which a student applies for a transfer, including
         disciplinary records, attendance records, special education
         records and health records. Consent is not required for the
         transfer of these records, except for confidential health
         records. At the request of the Superintendent of the School
         where a student seeks admission, the student's current or
         former School administrators shall provide, in a timely
         fashion, an oral or written report to the Superintendent
         indicating whether the student has been expelled or suspended
         or is the subject of an expulsion or suspension proceeding.

     E.  **Other Entities/Individuals**. Education records may be
         disclosed to other governmental entities and individuals as
         specifically permitted by FERPA and the accompanying
         regulations.

     F.  **Information on the Internet**. Under Maine law (20-A M.R.S.A.
         ยง 6001), MSSM shall not publish on the Internet any information
         that identifies a student, including but not limited to the
         student's full name, photograph, personal biography, e-mail
         address, home address, date of birth, social security number
         and parents' names, without written parental consent.

VIII. **WAIVER OF CONFIDENTIALITY RIGHTS**

      A parent/eligible student may waive any of his/her rights
      regarding confidentiality of educational records, but any such a
      waiver must be in writing and signed by the parent/eligible
      student. The School may not require that a parent/eligible student
      waive his or her rights. Any waiver may be revoked with respect to
      actions occurring after the revocation. If a parent executes a
      waiver, that waiver may be revoked by the student any time after
      he/she becomes an eligible student.

IX. **FEES FOR COPYING RECORDS**

    There shall be no charge to search for or retrieve education records
    of a student. MSSM shall provide copies of education records to
    parents/eligible students upon request. The cost of producing copies
    of the record to the parents/eligible student will be ten cents
    (\$0.10) per page copied, plus postage. Parents/eligible students
    who are unable to pay such fees will not be denied access to
    education records.

X.  **MAINTENANCE AND DESTRUCTION OF EDUCATION RECORDS**

    MSSM shall maintain accurate and up-to-date education records as
    required by federal and state statutes and regulations.

    A.  Records shall be maintained by personnel who are knowledgeable
        about the applicable confidentiality. All records shall be
        safeguarded from unauthorized access. Student records must be
        kept in a fireproof storage at the School or a duplicate set
        kept off-site.

    B.  The high School transcripts of all former students shall be kept
        in perpetuity by MSSM. A permanent record of a special education
        student's name, address, phone number, grades, attendance
        record, classes attended, and grade and year completed shall be
        maintained without time limitations. All other records will be
        maintained in accordance with Maine State Rules for Disposition
        of Local Government Records (Schedule L).

    C.  MSSM shall not destroy any education record if there is any
        outstanding request to inspect or review such records.

    D.  Records of access to education records shall be retained as long
        as the records themselves.

    E.  MSSM shall inform parents of students with disabilities when
        education records are no longer needed to provide educational
        services to the student or to demonstrate that the School has
        provided the student with a free appropriate public education as
        required by law. At that point, the records may be turned over
        to parent/eligible student upon their request, or destroyed in
        accordance with the parent's request or MSSM procedures.

XI. **COMPLAINTS**

    The United States Department of Education maintains an office that
    handles complaints about alleged violation of FERPA by local
    Schools. Complaints regarding violations of rights accorded
    parent/eligible students may be submitted in writing to:
