title: TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NONCONFORMING STUDENTS
---

I.  Purpose and Scope

    The Maine School of Science and Mathematics will strive to:

    1.  foster a learning environment that is safe, affirming, and free
        from discrimination, harassment and bullying for all students;
        and

    2.  assist in the educational and social integration and development
        of transgender and gender nonconforming students in our schools.
        This policy is intended to be interpreted in light of applicable
        federal and state laws and regulations, as well as Board
        policies, procedures, and school rules. This policy is not
        intended to anticipate every possible situation that may occur,
        since the needs of particular students differ. Administrators
        and school staff are expected to utilize this policy within the
        context of the individual needs of the student.

II. Definitions

    The following definitions are not intended to provide rigid labels
    for students, but to assist in discussing and addressing the needs
    of students. Administrators, school staff, volunteers, students, and
    others who interact with students are expected to be sensitive to
    the ways in which particular transgender and gender nonconforming
    students may wish to be identified.

    1.  Biological Sex - Biological sex relates to the anatomical,
        hormonal, and other structural and functional differences
        between people's bodies that are generally related to the
        expression of genes located on the X and Y sex chromosomes.

    2.  Gender Assigned at Birth - Male, female, intersex or other such
        designation given to a person, typically by a doctor, nurse,
        midwife or other medical professional when a person is born.
        This designation may be based on anatomical or other
        characteristics of the person's biological sex.

    3.  Gender Expression - The manner in which a person represents or
        expresses gender to others, often through behavior, clothing,
        hairstyles, activities, voice, or mannerisms.

    4.  Gender Identity - A person's deeply held knowledge of their own
        gender, which can include being female, male, another gender, or
        no gender. Gender identity encompasses how individuals perceive
        themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity
        can be the same or different than the gender assigned at birth.

    5.  Gender Nonconforming - A term sometimes used to describe people
        whose gender expression differs from social expectations, such
        as "feminine boys," "masculine girls," and people who are
        perceived as androgynous in some way. Being gender nonconforming
        is distinct from being transgender, though some trans people may
        consider themselves to be gender nonconforming,

    6.  Legal Gender - An individual's gender as recorded on such legal
        documents as a birth record, driver's license, or other state or
        federally issued identification. This is distinct from an
        individual's gender identity. In Maine law, the term gender
        marker is used to indicate the user's gender in certain legal
        documents. In Maine, gender markers include M (Male), F
        (Female), and X (non-binary).

    7.  Preferred Name - A name that may differ from a student's legal
        name, which is to be used by the staff and students at the
        school when communicating with or about that student. Note that
        in some cases, the student may request that staff and students
        use the student's legal name or other name when communicating
        with people outside of the school, including when communicating
        with parents, guardians, or other family members. A preferred
        name is sometimes referred to as a chosen name.

    8.  Sexual Orientation - A person's romantic and/or physical
        attraction to people of the same and/or another gender, such as
        being straight, gay, bisexual, or asexual.

    9.  Transgender - An adjective describing a person whose gender
        identity and/or expression is different from cultural
        expectations based on the sex/gender they were assigned at
        birth. Being transgender does not imply any specific sexual
        orientation.

III. Addressing the Needs of Transgender and Gender Nonconforming
     Students

     1.  The Maine School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM) is committed
         to addressing the needs of transgender and gender nonconforming
         students. As with all students, if a transgender or gender
         nonconforming student needs additional support, the student
         and/or the parent or guardian may contact school personnel in
         order to make an individual plan for the student. An individual
         support plan aims to engage the student, and possibly the
         parent or guardian, in creating a supportive plan that reflects
         and responds to the individual needs of the student in the
         school community. The administration will develop procedures
         for staff to follow to provide support for transgender
         students. School staff shall comply with any plan developed for
         a transgender student.

     2.  MSSM shall accept a student's assertion of their gender
         identity when there is consistent assertion of gender identity
         or any other evidence that the student's gender identity is
         sincerely held as a part of their core identity. MSSM will not
         require medical or mental health records as proof of a
         student's gender identity.

     3.  If MSSM has a credible and objective reason to believe that a
         transgender or gender nonconforming student's gender identity
         is being asserted for an improper purpose, the institution may
         seek additional clarification about the student's needs and
         objectives.

     4.  In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian
         do not agree as to the student's gender identity, or gender
         expression, MSSM shall, whenever possible, abide by the wishes
         of the student with regard to their gender identity and
         expression while at school. The school shall develop a plan
         along with the student to best support the student and their
         ability to be themself in the school environment, while at the
         same time minimizing any additional stress, conflict, or danger
         posed by such disagreement.

IV. Policy on Specific Issues

    1.  Privacy and Confidentiality: MSSM shall ensure that student
        records shall be kept confidential in accordance with applicable
        state, local and federal privacy laws. School staff shall comply
        with the student's wishes regarding disclosure to others of
        their transgender status, legal name, legal gender, preferred
        name, gender identity, pronouns, and gender assigned at birth
        unless students have explicitly authorized the disclosure.
        Examples of exceptions to this rule include, but are not limited
        to, FERPA required disclosures, use of a student's legal name
        for billing or on transcripts, or in medical situations where
        the individual's biological sex is relevant. Note that in the
        case of transgender status, preferred name, gender identity, and
        pronouns, this includes complying with the student's wishes
        regarding disclosure to parents and guardians.

    2.  School Records: MSSM shall maintain a permanent record for each
        student which includes their legal name and legal gender. In
        addition, at the request of a student, MSSM shall also maintain
        a record of the student's preferred name, pronouns, and gender
        identity. The legal name included in the student's record may be
        changed only upon proof that it has been changed pursuant to a
        court order.

    3.  Preferred Names: Any student at MSSM may request a preferred
        name to be used in place of their legal name within the school
        community provided that it is a name they use consistently in
        both academic and residential settings. In accordance with the
        wishes of the student, this name will be used everywhere
        possible: in printed documentation, verbal communication among
        both staff and students, and in electronic information systems.
        This includes, but is not limited to school identification,
        classroom rosters, and yearbooks. At the request of the student
        their legal name will be kept private to the extent allowed by
        FERPA and other laws and regulations.

    4.  Pronouns: Any student at MSSM may notify the school of their
        choice of pronouns to be used at the school, provided those
        pronouns are used consistently within the school setting. In
        accordance with the wishes of the student, these pronouns will
        be used everywhere possible: in printed documentation, verbal
        communication among both staff and students, and electronic
        information systems.

    5.  Housing and Roommates: Students and their parents may express
        preferences as to the location of housing and the selection of
        roommates based either on the student's biological sex or on
        their gender identity. MSSM will make all reasonable attempts to
        accommodate those preferences within the constraints imposed by
        state and federal laws.

    6.  Restrooms, Locker Rooms and Other Gender-Segregated Facilities:
        Students shall be permitted to use restrooms, locker rooms, and
        changing facilities corresponding to their gender identity. The
        school will provide reasonable alternative facilities such as a
        separate stall or a staff facility in accordance with a student
        preference for greater privacy. A student shall not be required
        to use a separate, non-communal facility over their objection.

    7.  Gender-Segregated Facilities or Activities: As a general matter,
        MSSM should try to avoid gender-based activities, policies, and
        practices except where they serve an important educational
        purpose. In other facilities, activities, policies, or practices
        when students may be separated by gender, students shall be able
        to participate in accordance with the gender identity asserted
        at school. Interscholastic athletic activities should be
        addressed through the Maine Principals Association Transgender
        Participation Policy, and school staff will support students
        navigating the eligibility process to try to ensure a respectful
        and supportive process for the students.

    8.  Dress Code: Any dress code instituted at MSSM shall, as much as
        possible, be gender neutral and apply equally to all students.
        Students must dress consistently with any applicable
        requirements in the dress code or school rules.

    9.  Discrimination: School staff should be sensitive to the fact
        that transgender students are at higher risk for discrimination,
        harassment, and bullying and should immediately notify the Title
        IX Coordinator or other administrator (according to the policies
        listed below) if they become aware of a problem. Discrimination,
        harassment, and bullying of students based on sex, sexual
        orientation, gender identity, and gender expression are
        prohibited by Title IX, the Maine Human Rights Act, and by MSSM
        Policies including policies AC, ACAA, ACAA-R, and JICK.

V.  Training and Dissemination of Informational Materials

    1.  The Title IX Coordinator shall ensure that staff receive
        training on this policy and on issues facing transgender and
        gender nonconforming students on an annual basis.

    2.  Teachers and other staff who have responsibilities for a
        transgender or gender nonconforming student will receive support
        in implementing this policy and, if applicable, in implementing
        a plan for an individual student.
