title: PROCEDURES ON PHYSICAL RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION
---

These procedures are established for the purpose of meeting the
obligations of the Maine School of Science and Mathematics under state
law and policy JKAA governing the use of physical restraint and
seclusion. These procedures shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
with state law.

I.  **DEFINITIONS**

    For purposes of these procedures, the terms "physical restraint" and
    "seclusion" shall have the meanings defined in policy JKAA.
    Definitions for other important terms in this procedure include:

    A.  Emergency: A sudden, urgent occurrence, usually unexpected, but
        sometimes anticipated, that requires immediate action.

    B.  Risk of injury or harm: A situation in which a student has the
        means to cause physical harm or injury to him/herself or others
        and such injury or harm is likely to occur, such that an
        employee would take steps to protect the student and others
        against the risk of such injury or harm.

    C.  Dangerous behavior: Behavior that presents a risk of injury or
        harm to a student or others.

    D.  Serious bodily injury: Any bodily injury that involves: (1) A
        substantial risk of death; (2) Extreme physical pain; (3)
        Protracted and obvious disfigurement; or (4) Protracted loss or
        impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or mental
        faculty.

II. **PHYSICAL RESTRAINT**

    To the extent possible, physical restraint will be implemented by
    trained staff. If untrained staff have intervened and initiated a
    physical restraint in an emergency, trained staff must be summoned
    to the scene to assume control of the situation if the emergency
    continues.

    This procedure does not preclude law enforcement personnel from
    implementing physical restraints in carrying out their professional
    responsibilities.

    A.  Permitted Uses of Physical Restraint

        1.  Physical restraint may be used only as an emergency
            intervention other less intrusive interventions have failed
            or been deemed inappropriate.

        2.  Physical restraint may be used to move a student only if the
            need for movement outweighs the risk of taking no action.

        3.  Prescribed medications and other assistive or protective
            devices may be used.

    B.  Prohibited Forms and Uses of Physical Restraint

        1.  Physical restraint used for punitive purposes; for staff
            convenience; or to control challenging behavior.

        2.  Physical restraint used to prevent property destruction in
            the absence of a risk of injury or harm.

        3.  Physical restraint that restricts the free movement of a
            student's diaphragm or chest, or that restricts the airway
            so as to interrupt normal breathing or speech
            (restraint-related asphyxia).

        4.  Physical restraint that relies on pain for control,
            including but not limited to joint hyperextension, excessive
            force, unsupported take-downs (e.g., tackles), the use of
            any physical structure (e.g., wall, railing or post),
            punching, and hitting.

        5.  Aversive procedures and mechanical and chemical restraints.

            a.  Aversive procedures are defined as the use of a
                substance or stimulus, intended to modify behavior,
                which the person administering it knows or should know
                is likely to cause physical and/or emotional trauma to a
                student, even when the substance or stimulus appears to
                be pleasant or neutral to others. Such substances and
                stimuli include but are not limited to infliction of
                bodily pain (e.g., hitting, pinching, slapping); water
                spray; noxious fumes; extreme physical exercise;
                costumes, or signs.

            b.  Mechanical restraints are defined as any item worn by or
                placed on the student to limit behavior or movement and
                which cannot be removed by the student. Prescribed
                assistive devices are not considered mechanical
                restraints.

            c.  Chemical restraints are defined as the use of
                medication, including those administered as needed,
                given involuntarily to control student behavior.
                Prescribed medications are not considered chemical
                restraints.

    C.  Monitoring Students in Physical Restraint

        1.  At least two adults must be present at all times when
            physical restraint is used except when, for safety reasons,
            waiting for a second adult to arrive is precluded by the
            particular circumstances.

        2.  The student must be continuously monitored until he/she no
            longer presents a risk of injury or harm to him/herself or
            others.

        3.  If an injury occurs, applicable School policies and
            procedures should be followed.

    D.  Termination of Physical Restraint

        1.  The staff involved in the use of physical restraint must
            continually assess for signs that the student is no longer
            presenting a risk of injury or harm to him/herself or others
            and the emergency intervention must be discontinued as soon
            as possible.

            a.  The time a student is in physical restraint must be
                monitored and documented.

            b.  If physical restraint continues for more than ten (10)
                minutes, a trained staff member shall determine whether
                continued physical restraint is warranted, and shall
                continue to monitor the status of the physical restraint
                every ten (10) minutes until the restraint is
                terminated.

            c.  If the student continues to present behaviors that
                create a risk of injury or harm to him/herself or
                others, then staff may request additional assistance
                from other School staff, parents, medical providers, or
                other appropriate persons or organizations.

III. **SECLUSION**.

     To the extent possible, seclusion will be implemented by staff
     certified in a training program. If untrained staff have intervened
     and initiated seclusion in an emergency, trained staff must be
     summoned to the scene as soon as possible.

     A.  Permitted Uses and Location of Seclusion

         1.  Seclusion may be used only as an emergency intervention
             when the behavior of a student presents a non-immediate
             risk of injury or harm to the student or others, and only
             after other less intrusive interventions have failed or
             been deemed inappropriate.

         2.  Seclusion may be achieved in any part of the School
             building with adequate light, heat, ventilation, and normal
             room height.

             a.  Seclusion may not take place in a locked room.

             b.  If a specific room is designated as a seclusion room,
                 it must be a minimum of sixty (60) square feet; have
                 adequate light, heat, and ventilation; be of normal
                 room height; contain an unbreakable observation window
                 in a wall or door; and must be free of hazardous
                 materials and objects which the student could use to
                 self-inflict bodily injury.

             c.  Parents may be requested to provide assistance at any
                 time.

     B.  Prohibited Uses of Seclusion

         1.  Seclusion used for punitive purposes; for staff
             convenience; or to control challenging behavior.

         2.  Seclusion used to prevent property destruction in the
             absence of risk of injury or harm.

     C.  Monitoring Students in Seclusion

         1.  At least one adult must be physically present at all times
             to continuously monitor a student in seclusion. The adult,
             while not present in the room or defined area, must be
             situated so that the student is visible at all times.

         2.  The student must be continuously monitored until he/she no
             longer presents a risk of injury or harm to him/herself or
             others.

         3.  If an injury occurs, applicable School policies and
             procedures should be followed.

     D.  Termination of Seclusion

         1.  The staff involved in the seclusion must continually assess
             for signs that the student is no longer presenting a risk
             of injury or harm to him/herself or others and the
             emergency intervention must be discontinued as soon as
             possible.

             a.  The time a student is in seclusion must be monitored
                 and recorded.

             b.  If seclusion continues for more than ten (10) minutes,
                 an administrator/designee shall determine whether
                 continued seclusion is warranted, and shall continue to
                 monitor the status of the seclusion every ten (10)
                 minutes until the seclusion is terminated.

             c.  If the student continues to present behaviors that
                 create a risk of injury or harm to him/herself or
                 others, then staff may request additional assistance
                 from other School staff, parents, medical providers, or
                 other appropriate persons or organizations.

IV. **NOTIFICATION AND REPORTS OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION
    INCIDENTS.**

    For the purposes of this procedure, an "incident" consists of all
    actions between the time a student begins to create a risk of harm
    and the time the student ceases to pose a risk of harm.

    A.  Notice Requirements

        After each incident of physical restraint or seclusion:

        1.  A staff member involved in the incident shall make an oral
            notification to the administrator/designee as soon as
            possible, but no later than the end of the day.

        2.  An administrator/designee shall notify the parent/legal
            guardian about the physical restraint or seclusion (and any
            related first aid provided) as soon as practical, but within
            the day in which the incident occurred. The
            administrator/designee must utilize all available phone
            numbers or other available contact information to reach the
            parent/legal guardian. If the parent/legal guardian is
            unavailable, the administrator/designee must leave a message
            (if the parent/legal guardian has a phone and message
            capability) to contact the School as soon as possible. The
            parent/legal guardian must be informed that written
            documentation will be provided within seven (7) calendar
            days.

        3.  If serious bodily injury or death of a student occurs during
            the implementation of physical restraint or seclusion,
            MSSM's emergency notification procedures shall be followed
            and an administrator/designeeshall notify the Maine
            Department of Education within twenty-four (24) hours or the
            next business day.

    B.  Incident Reports

        Each use of physical restraint or seclusion must be documented
        in an incident report. The incident report must be completed and
        provided to an administrator/designee as soon as practical, and
        in all cases within two (2) days of the incident.

        The parent/legal guardian must be provided a copy of the
        incident report within seven (7) calendar days of the incident.

        The incident report must include the following elements:

        1.  Student name;
        2.  Age, gender and grade;
        3.  Location of the incident;
        4.  Date of the incident;
        5.  Date of report;
        6.  Person completing the report;
        7.  Beginning and ending time of each physical restraint and/or
            seclusion;
        8.  Total time of incident;
        9.  Description of prior events and circumstances; 10. Less
            restrictive interventions tried prior to the use of physical
            restraint and/or seclusion and, if none were used, the
            reasons why;
        10. The student behavior justifying the use of physical
            restraint or seclusion;
        11. A detailed description of the physical restraint or
            seclusion used; 13. The staff person(s) involved, their role
            in the physical restraint or seclusion, and whether each
            person is certified in an MSSM-approved training program;
        12. Description of the incident, including the resolution and
            process of returning the student to his/her program, if
            appropriate;
        13. Whether the student has an IEP, 504 Plan, behavior plan, IHP
            (individual health plan) or any other plan;
        14. If a student and/or staff sustained bodily injury, the date
            and time of nurse or other response personnel notification
            and any treatment administered;
        15. The date, time and method of parent/legal guardian
            notification; and
        16. The date and time of administrator/designee notification.

        Copies of the incident reports shall be maintained in the
        student's file and in the school office. The
        administrator/designee will debrief involved staff members.

V.  **SCHOOL RESPONSE FOLLOWING THE USE OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINT OR
    SECLUSION.**

    A.  Following receipt of an incident report, an
        administrator/designee shall take these steps within two (2)
        school days (unless serious bodily injury requiring emergency
        medical treatment occurred, in which case these steps must take
        place as soon as possible, but no later than the next school
        day):

        1.  Review the incident with all staff persons involved to
            discuss: (a) whether the use of physical restraint or
            seclusion complied with state and Board of Trustee
            requirements and (b) how to prevent or reduce the need for
            physical restraint and/or seclusion in the future.

        2.  Meet with the student who was physically restrained or
            secluded to discuss: (a) what triggered the student's
            escalation and (b) what the student and staff can do to
            reduce the need for physical restraint and/or seclusion in
            the future. Whenever possible, a parent/legal guardian shall
            be present at this meeting.

    B.  Following the meetings, staff must develop and implement a
        written plan for response and de-escalation for the student. If
        a plan already exists, staff must review it and make revisions,
        if appropriate. For the purposes of this procedure,
        "de-escalation" is the use of behavior management techniques
        intended to cause a situation involving problem behavior of a
        student to become more controlled, calm, and less dangerous,
        thus reducing the risk of injury or harm.

VI. **PROCEDURE FOR STUDENTS WITH ONE OR MORE INCIDENTS IN A SCHOOL
    YEAR**

    MSSM will make reasonable, documented efforts to encourage
    parent/legal guardian participation in the meetings required in this
    section, and to schedule meetings at times convenient for
    parents/legal guardians to attend. If a student has a seclusion or
    physical restraint incident, he/she may be dismissed from MSSM.

    A.  Special Education/504 Students

        1.  After an incident of physical restraint and/or seclusion in
            one school year, the student's IEP or 504 Team shall meet
            within ten (10) school days of the incident to discuss and
            consider the need to conduct an FBA (functional behavioral
            assessment) and/or develop a BIP (behavior intervention
            plan), or amend an existing one.

    B.  All Other Students

        1.  A team consisting of the parent/legal guardian,
            administrator/designee, the student's advisor, a staff
            member involved in the incident (if not the
            administrator/designee already invited), and other
            appropriate staff shall meet within ten (10) school days to
            discuss the incident.

        2.  The team shall consider the appropriateness of a referral to
            special education and, regardless of whether a referral to
            special education is made, the need to conduct an FBA
            (functional behavior assessment) and/or develop a BIP
            (behavior intervention plan).

VII. **CUMULATIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS**

     A.  Reports within the School

         1.  The Dean of Students must report the following data on a
             quarterly and annual basis:

             a.  Aggregate number of uses of physical restraint;
             b.  Aggregate number of students placed in physical
                 restraint;
             c.  Aggregate number of uses of seclusion;
             d.  Aggregate number of students placed in seclusion;
             e.  Aggregate number of serious bodily injuries to students
                 related to the use of physical restraints and
                 seclusions; and
             f.  Aggregate number of serious bodily injuries to staff
                 related to physical restraint and seclusion.

         2.  The Executive Director shall review the cumulative reports
             and identify any areas that could be addressed to reduce
             the future use of physical restraint and seclusion.

     B.  Reports to Maine Department of Education

         1.  The Executive Director/designee shall submit report to the
             Maine Department of Education on an annual basis that
             includes the information required in Section 7.A.1 above.
