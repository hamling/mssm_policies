title: USE OF PHYSICAL RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION
---

The Maine School of Science and Mathematics Board of Trustees has
adopted this policy and the accompanying procedure to implement the
standards for use of physical restraint and seclusion with students, as
required by state law and regulations, and to support a safe school
environment. Physical restraint and seclusion, as defined by this
policy, may only be used as an emergency intervention when the behavior
of a student presents a risk of injury or harm to the student or others.

The Executive Director has overall responsibility for implementing this
policy and the accompanying procedure, but may delegate specific
responsibilities as he/she deems appropriate.

I.  **DEFINITIONS**

    The following definitions apply to this policy and procedure:

    A.  Physical restraint: An intervention that restricts a student's
        freedom of movement or normal access to his or her body, and
        includes physically moving a student who has not moved
        voluntarily.

        ## Physical restraint does not include any of the following:

        1.  Physical escort: A temporary touching or holding inducing a
            student to walk to another location, including assisting the
            student to the student's feet in order to be escorted.

        2.  Physical prompt: A teaching technique that involves physical
            contact with the student and that enables the student to
            learn or model the physical movement necessary for the
            development of the desired competency.

        3.  Physical contact: When the purpose of the intervention is to
            comfort a student and the student voluntarily accepts the
            contact.

        4.  A brief period of physical contact necessary to break up a
            fight.

        5.  Momentarily deflecting the movement of a student when the
            student's movements would be destructive, harmful, or
            dangerous to the student or others.

        6.  The use of seat belts, safety belts, or similar passenger
            restraints, when used as intended during the transportation
            of a child in a motor vehicle.

        7.  The use of a medically prescribed harness, when used as
            intended; the use of protective equipment or devices that
            are part of a treatment plan prescribed by a licensed health
            care provider; or prescribed assistive devices when used as
            prescribed and supervised by qualified and trained
            individuals.

        8.  Restraints used by law enforcement officers in the course of
            their professional duties are not subject to this
            policy/procedure or DOE Rule Chapter 33.

        9.  DOE Rule Chapter 33 does not restrict or limit the
            protections available to school officials under 20-A
            M.R.S.A. §4009, but those protections do not relieve school
            officials from complying with this policy/procedure.

    B.  Seclusion: The involuntary confinement of a student alone in a
        room or clearly defined area from which the student is
        physically prevented from leaving, with no other person in the
        room or area with the student.

        ## Seclusion does not include:

        1.  Timeout: An intervention where a student requests, or
            complies with an adult request for, a break.

        2.  Restricting a student to their dormitory room.

        3.  Being confined to a room where others are present.

II. **PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTING PHYSICAL RESTRAINT AND SECLUSION**

    The requirements for implementing physical restraint and seclusion,
    as well as incident notices, documentation, and reporting are
    included in the accompanying procedure, JKAA-R.

III. **ANNUAL NOTICE OF POLICY/PROCEDURE.**

     policy/procedure by means determined by the Executive
     Director/designee.

IV. **TRAINING REQUIREMENTS**

    A.  All School staff and contracted providers shall receive an
        annual overview of this policy/procedure.

    B.  MSSM will ensure that there are a sufficient number of
        administrators/designees, special education, and other staff who
        maintain certification in a restraint and seclusion training
        program. A list of certified staff shall be updated annually and
        maintained in the Executive Director's Office and in the
        School's Emergency Management Plan.

V.  **PARENT/LEGAL GUARDIAN COMPLAINT PROCEDURE**

    A parent/legal guardian who has a complaint concerning the
