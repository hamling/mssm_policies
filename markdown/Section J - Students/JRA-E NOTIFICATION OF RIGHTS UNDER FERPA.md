title: NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS UNDER FERPA
---

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords parents
and students over 18 years of age (eligible students) certain rights
with respect to the student's education records. They are:

A.  The right to inspect and review the student's education records
    within 45 days of the day MSSM receives a request for access.

    Parents or eligible students should submit to the School a written
    request that identifies the record(s) they wish to inspect. The
    Superintendent will make arrangements for access and notify the
    parent or eligible student of the time and place where the records
    may be inspected.

B.  The right to request the amendment of the student's education
    records that the parent or eligible student believes are inaccurate
    or misleading.

    Parents or eligible students may ask MSSM to amend a record that
    they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write the
    Superintendent, clearly identify the part of the record they want
    changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading.

    If MSSM decides not to amend the record as requested by the parent
    or eligible student, MSSM will notify the parent or eligible student
    of the decision and advise them of their right to a hearing
    regarding the request for amendment. Additional information
    regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the parent or
    eligible student when notified of the right to a hearing.

C.  The right to consent to disclosure of personally identifiable
    information contained in the student's education records, except to
    the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.

    One exception that permits disclosure without consent is disclosure
    to School officials with legitimate educational interests. A School
    official is a person employed by MSSM as an administrator,
    supervisor, instructor or support staff member (including health or
    medical staff); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; a person
    or company with whom MSSM has contracted to perform a special task
    (such as an attorney, auditor, medical consultant or therapist); or
    a parent or student serving on an official committee, such as a
    disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another School
    official in performing his/her tasks.

    A School official has a legitimate educational interest if the
    official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill
    his/her professional responsibility.

    Upon request, MSSM discloses education records without consent to
    officials of another School district in which a student seeks or
    intends to enroll.

D.  The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education
    concerning alleged failures by MSSM to comply with the requirements
    of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA
    is:

    > Family Policy Compliance Office\
    > U.S. Department of Education\
    > 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W.\
    > Washington, DC 20202-4605

E.  MSSM may make public at its discretion personally identifiable
    information from the education records of a student without parental
    consent if that information has been designated as directory
    information by the School. MSSM has designated the following
    information as directory information: the student's name,
    participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weight
    and height of athletes, and honors and awards received.

    Such information will not be disclosed if the parent of the student
    informs MSSM in writing within 10 days of the first student day of
    the School year or within 10 days after enrollment, that such
    information is not to be designated as directory information with
    respect to that student. Any such notice should be sent to the
    Superintendent at the following address:

    > MSSM\
    > Superintendent\
    > 95 High Street\
    > Limestone, ME 04750

F.  Federal law permits military recruiters and institutions of higher
    learning to request and receive the names, addresses and telephone
    numbers of high School students upon request, unless the student's
    parent or eligible student notifies MSSM that he/she does not want
    such information released. Such information will not be disclosed if
    the student's parent or eligible student notifies MSSM, in writing,
    that such information should not be released without his/her written
    consent. Any such notice should be sent to

    > MSSM\
    > Superintendent\
    > 95 High Street\
    > Limestone, ME 04750

G.  Under Maine law, MSSM shall not publish on the Internet without
    written parental consent any information, whether directory or
    otherwise, that identifies a student, including but not limited to
    the student's full name, photograph, personal biography, e-mail
    address, home address, date of birth, social security number, and
    parents' names.

    MSSM maintains a more extensive policy and procedure concerning
    education records. This policy and procedure can be obtained by
    contacting the Superintendent.
