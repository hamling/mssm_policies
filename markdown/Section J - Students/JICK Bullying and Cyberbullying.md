title: BULLYING AND CYBERBULLYING
---

I.  Introduction

    All students have the right to attend public schools that are safe
    and secure learning environments. It is the intent of the Maine
    School of Science and Mathematics (MSSM) Board of Trustees to
    provide all students with an equitable opportunity to learn. To that
    end, the Board has a significant interest in providing a safe,
    orderly, and respectful School environment that is conducive to
    teaching and learning.

    Bullying is detrimental to the School environment and student
    learning, achievement, and well-being. It interferes with the
    mission of MSSM to educate our students and disrupts the operation
    of the School. Bullying affects not only students who are targets,
    but also those who participate and witness such behavior. These
    behaviors must be addressed to ensure student safety and an
    inclusive learning environment.

    It is not the Board's intent to prohibit students from expressing
    their ideas, including ideas that may offend the sensibilities of
    others, or from engaging in civil debate. However, the Board does
    not condone and will take action in response to conduct that
    interferes with students' opportunity to learn, the educational
    mission of MSSM, and the operation of the School.

II. Prohibited Behavior

    The following behaviors are prohibited:

    1.  Bullying;
    2.  Cyber bullying;
    3.  Harassment and sexual harassment (as defined in policy ACAA);
    4.  Retaliation against those reporting such defined behaviors; and
    5.  Knowing and false accusations of bullying behavior.

    Any person who engages in any of these prohibited behaviors that
    constitutes bullying shall be subject to disciplinary action.

III. Bullying and Cyber Bullying Defined

     A.  "Bullying" includes, but is not limited to, a written, oral, or
         electronic expression or a physical act or gesture or any
         combination thereof directed at a student or students that:

             effect of:

             (a) Physically harming a student or damaging a student's
                 property; or

             (b) Placing a student in reasonable fear of physical harm
                 or damage to the student's property;

         2.  Interferes with the rights of a student by:

             distinguishing characteristic; or is based on a student's
             association with a person with one or more of these actual
             or perceived characteristics; and that has the effect
             described in subparagraph (1) or (2) above. (These
             behaviors might also meet the criteria for harassment as
             defined in policy ACAA: Harassment and Sexual Harassment of

         school practices to repair the harm done to relationships and
         persons from the student's misbehavior.

IV. Application of Policy

        decision of the Executive Director or designee related to taking

         appropriate services.

VIII. Appeal

      An appeal against the resolution of the complaint can be made to
