title: STUDENT PLACEMENT AND TRANSFER CREDITS
---

## Placement

Placement will be determined by students' transcripts, past work,
standardized test scores, and MSSM placement exam results.

## Transfer credits

The following table indicates the number of high school mathematics,
science, and English classes students may transfer in to MSSM:

  **Entering MSSM as...**   **Maximum number of transferred math, science, English credits allowed**
  ------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Freshmen                  none
  Sophomores                1 math, 1 science, 1 English
  Juniors                   2 math, 2 science, 2 English
  Seniors                   3 math, 3 science, 3 English

Classes will transfer to MSSM provided the student earned a C- or better
in the courses. MSSM does not grant credit for courses taken at another
high school when a student is enrolled at MSSM. After entering MSSM,
transferred credit is limited to pre-approved courses taken at a college
or university. Students will only receive credit for courses in which a
grade of C- or better is earned. This applies to a course taken at the
student's initiative and/or for one being repeated as required by the
School when a course has been failed. Transferred courses will be
documented as such.
