title: ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICATION
---

MSSM recognizes that in some instances a student's chronic or short-term
illness, injury, or disabling condition may require the administration
of medication, whether prescribed or over-the-counter, during the school
day.

The School will not deny educational opportunities to students requiring
the administration of medication in order to remain in attendance and
participate in the educational program. Failure on the part of the
student to take medications as prescribed by their medical practitioner
could result in suspension or dismissal. The intent of this policy is to
promote the safe administration of medications to students by trained
School personnel and to provide for authorization of student emergency
self-administration of medication from asthma inhalers and epinephrine
pens. The School encourages collaboration between parents/legal
guardians and the School in these efforts.

The School disclaims any and all responsibility for the diagnosis,
prescription of treatment, and medication for any student.

A.  **Administration of Medication by School Personnel**

    Medications may be administered during the School day by unlicensed
    School personnel acting within the scope of their training only.
    Based upon documentation of training and competency in the
    administration of medication, the School Nurse will authorize
    trained persons to administer medication.

B.  **Required Training of Unlicensed Personnel to Administer
    Medication**

    All unlicensed personnel who administer medication must receive
    training before being authorized to do so. Such training must be
    provided by a registered professional nurse or physician. The
    training on administration of medication must include the following
    components:

    1.  Current laws and school policies related to medication
        administration,

    2.  Resources available to staff regarding medication
        administration,

    3.  Basic anatomy of routes of medication (ex. gastro-intestinal
        route, lung, ear, eye, and nose),

    4.  Basic classification of medications,

    5.  Common medications with side effects,

    6.  How to read a medication label,

    7.  How to document medications administered and medication errors,

    8.  The five rights of medication administration (right student,
        right medication, right dose, right time, and right route),

    9.  Procedure/protocols for administering medication(s),

    10. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis,

    11. Signs and symptoms of adverse effects,

    12. Responding to emergencies,

    13. Working with parents, and

    14. Protecting the confidentiality of student health information.

    The trainer shall document the training and competency of unlicensed
    School personnel to administer medication. Following the initial
    training, a training review and information update must be held at
    least annually for those unlicensed School personnel authorized to
    administer medication.

C.  **Confidentiality**

    To the extent legally permissible, staff members and chaperones may
    be provided with such information regarding medication and its
    administration or self-administration as may be in the best interest
    of the student.

D.  **Administration of Medication During Field Trips and
    School-Sponsored Events**

    The School will accommodate students requiring administration of
    medication during field trips or School-sponsored events. All staff
    who wish to or will be expected to chaperone any off-campus trip
    shall attend medication distribution training each fall during Staff
    Training Week.

E.  **Healthcare Provider's Order**

    All prescription medications must be accompanied by a written order
    from the student's healthcare provider substantiating the fact that
    the administration of a particular medication during the student's
    enrollment is necessary for the student's health and attendance at
    MSSM. Such order must include the following:

    1.  the student's name;

    2.  the name of the medication;

    3.  the dose;

    4.  the route of administration (e.g., tablets, liquid, drops);

    5.  time intervals for administration (e.g., every four hours,
        before meals);

    6.  any special instructions; and

    7.  the name of the prescribing healthcare provider.

    It is the responsibility of trained School personnel to clarify any
    medication order that he or she believes to be inappropriate or
    ambiguous. Personnel may decline to administer a medication if
    he/she believes such administration would jeopardize student safety,
    notifying the parent, the student's healthcare provider, Director of
    Health Services and Dean of Students/Director of Residential Life.

    The parent is responsible for notifying the School of any changes in
    or discontinuation of a prescribed medication that is being
    administered to the student at MSSM.

F.  **Delivery of, Storage of, and Recordkeeping for Medications**

    Parents will send all prescriptions to the school's preferred
    pharmacy. No more than a 30-day (one month) supply of medication
    shall be kept at School, excluding inhalers and epinephrine pens.
    The parent will be responsible for sending new prescriptions to the
    pharmacy. MSSM staff will be responsible for collecting medications
    from the pharmacy. The School nurse will send home or dispose of any
    medication no longer required or that remains at the end of the
    School year.

    Student medications will be stored at the nurse's office in a secure
    location at room temperature unless prescription storage
    instructions specify differently. Refrigeration is available, if
    required. School staff administering medication shall document each
    instance medication is administered including the date, time, and
    dosage given.

    Properly trained personnel shall maintain a record that includes any
    parent's request, physician's order, details of the specific
    medications (including dosage and timing of medication), and
    documentation of each instance the medication is administered.

    Records shall be retained according to the current State Record
    Retention schedules pertaining to student health records.

G.  **Student Self-Administration**

    Students with allergies or asthma may be authorized by the School
    nurse, in consultation with an authorized clinician, to possess and
    self-administer emergency medication from an epinephrine pen
    (EpiPen) or asthma inhaler during the School day, during field
    trips, School-sponsored events, or while on a School bus. The
    student shall be authorized to possess and self-administer
    medication from an epinephrine pen or asthma inhaler if the
    following conditions have been met:

    1.  The parent (or student, if 18 years of age or older) must
        request in writing authorization for the student to
        self-administer medication from an epinephrine pen or asthma
        inhaler.

    2.  The student's parent/legal guardian (or student, if 18 years of
        age or older) must submit written verification to the School
        from the student's primary care provider confirming that the
        student has the knowledge and the skills to safely possess and
        properly and effectively use an epinephrine pen or asthma
        inhaler.

    3.  The School cannot accurately monitor the frequency and
        appropriateness of use when the student self-administers
        medication and that the School will not be responsible for any
        injury arising from the student's self-medication or lack
        thereof.

    Authorization granted to a student to possess and self-administer
    medication from an epinephrine pen or asthma inhaler shall be valid
    for the current School year only and must be renewed annually.

    A student's authorization to possess and self-administer medication
    from an epinephrine pen or asthma inhaler may be limited or revoked
    by the School nurse after consultation with the student's parents
    (or student, if 18 years of age or older) or if the student
    demonstrates inability to responsibly possess and self-administer
    such medication.

    Other prescription or over-the-counter medications may be
    self-administered after approval from School nurse. Sharing,
    borrowing, or distribution of medication is prohibited. The
    student's authorization to self-administer medication may be revoked
    and the student may be subject to disciplinary consequences for
    violation of this policy.
