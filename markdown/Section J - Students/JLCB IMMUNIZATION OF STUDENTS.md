title: IMMUNIZATION OF STUDENTS
---

Where MSSM is a residential School where students are in close proximity
for extended times, it is particularly important that students are
immunized.

All students who enroll in the School are required by Maine law to
present a certificate of immunization or evidence of immunization or
immunity against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough),
tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella (chicken pox) and
meningitis. MSSM requires in addition that all students be immunized or
show evidence of immunity from hepatitis A and meningitis. MSSM also
recommends that students be inoculated with the appropriate flu vaccine
every year.

Non-immunized students shall not be permitted to attend School unless
one of the following conditions is met:

A.  The parents/guardians provide to the school written assurance that
    the child will be immunized within 90 days of enrolling in school or
    his/her first attendance in classes, whichever date is earlier. This
    option is available only once to each student during their school
    career; or

B.  The parents/guardians provide a physician's written statement each
    year that immunization against one or more diseases may be medically
    inadvisable (as defined by law/regulation); or

C.  The parents/guardians state in writing each year that immunization
    is contrary to their sincere religious or philosophical beliefs.

D.  The parents/guardians grant written consent for their child to be
    immunized by a public health officer, physician, nurse or other
    authorized person employed by or acting as an agent of the School.

The Executive Director shall exclude from the School any non-immunized
student when there is a clear danger to the health of students, staff,
and the general public as provided by law. If a student is absent from
the School due to conditions in this paragraph for more than ten days,
the Executive Director shall make arrangements to meet the educational
needs of the student.

Any student not immunized shall be sent home in the event of an outbreak
of any illness or disease above-stated for which the student is not
immunized. Unvaccinated students in the case of an outbreak of disease
in which they are not vaccinated against will be excluded from School
for at least 16 days from the last identified case.

The student will be allowed to return to the School once the School's
medical personnel deem it appropriate. In the event that the student is
sent home due to the conditions in this paragraph, the School is not
required to provide tutoring, off-site classes, or other academic
accommodations.

The Executive Director in consultation with School medical personnel has
broad authority to modify the requirements of this policy as conditions
and events change.
